  Greedy coin change (canonical system {1,2,5,10}) — a PARTIAL port of AoPA
  `Examples/GC/CoinChange.agda` (Mu–Oliveira, "Programming from Galois connections").

  SPEC (program-independent).  A valid change for an amount `n` is any coin list summing to `n`:
      `coinSpec n out  :=  sumVal out = n`.
  The wanted answer is the one using the FEWEST coins.  In AoPA this is the shrink
  `(sumc ○ ordered?)˘ ↾ _⊴_`: change relations shrunk by the sub-list order `_⊴_`, so the minimal
  (fewest-coin) solution survives — and via `A7_6.shrink_eq_A_comp_minRel` that shrink IS
  `A coinSpec ≫ minRel _⊴_`, the Bird & de Moor `min · Λ` optimum.

  WHAT IS PORTED HERE (self-contained, proved, axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}):
    * the coin algebra `Coin`/`val`/`sumVal` and the coin order `leC` (AoPA `_≤c_`);
    * the greedy program `greedy : ℕ → List Coin` (take the largest coin ≤ the remainder);
    * ACHIEVABILITY as a morphism inequality: `graph greedy ⊑ coinSpec` (`greedy_sound_rel`) —
      the greedy list always makes exact change (the `hsound` half of the headline).

  WHAT IS BLOCKED (precise diagnosis — NOT a `sorry`, deliberately omitted).  The full AoPA
  derivation `graph greedy = A coinSpec ≫ minRel _⊴_` needs two things the repo does not yet have:
    (1) OPTIMALITY / the domination half.  AoPA proves it by the ~100-line exchange argument
        `greedy-lemma` (a finite case analysis over {1,2,5,10}) fed to the GENERIC-functor greedy
        theorem `Data.Generic.Greedy.greedy-ana-cxt`, together with `Data.Generic.Membership` (`ε`)
        and a well-founded-relation accessibility proof `wf`.  The repo's optimization layer is
        `A7_2.greedy_max`/`A7_4.horner_correct`, which are CATAMORPHISM (fold) greedy theorems;
        coin change is an ANAMORPHISM (`hylo In pick-max wf`, an amount→coins UNFOLD), for which the
        repo has no emergence/uniqueness law at the `Rel(Set)` level.  The generic greedy-ana theorem
        is being ported by a sibling agent; per the task this file must not depend on it.
    (2) UNIQUENESS.  `RelSet.eq_A_comp_maxRel` pins the optimum by ANTISYMMETRY of the preference
        order; "fewest coins" ordered only by length is NOT antisymmetric.  AoPA restores
        antisymmetry with `ordered?` (canonical descending form) + the sub-list order `_⊴_`; porting
        that canonicalization + the `_⊴_` antisymmetry is the second missing piece.
  Both are LIST/combinatorial, not deep — but each is a substantial development, and (1) additionally
  waits on anamorphism infrastructure.  A follow-up with the generic greedy-ana layer can complete
  `graph greedy = A coinSpec ≫ minRel D` from the achievability proved here plus the exchange lemma.

  Mathlib-free.

    (fewest-coins domination) is the blocked exchange argument described in the file header. -/
