  A mathlib-free purely functional min-priority-queue (leftist heap) over `Int`.

  This backs an O(N log k) re-derivation of "Merge k Sorted Lists": keep the current head of each
  of the `k` lists in one heap, repeatedly `popMin?` the global minimum, and `insert` that list's
  next element.  A leftist heap gives O(log n) `merge`/`insert`/`popMin?` (the complexity claim is
  INFORMAL — it is not stated or proved in Lean; only functional correctness is machine-checked).

  Representation: a leftist heap is a binary tree with a min-heap order (every node's value is ≤ all
  values below it) and the *leftist* shape invariant (the right spine is shortest, tracked by a
  stored `rank`).  Only the min-heap order and the multiset of elements matter for correctness, so
  the leftist shape is used to guide `merge` but never proved — it is pure performance bookkeeping.

  We chose a LEFTIST heap over a pairing heap because a plain binary tree gives clean *structural*
  induction for `toList`/`IsHeap`/all invariant lemmas; only `merge` needs well-founded recursion
  (on the total node count), a single standard obligation.  A pairing heap `node v (kids : List _)`
  is a *nested* inductive whose custom induction principle makes every proof fight the recursor.

  What is proved (all sorry-free; see `#print axioms` at the bottom):
  * `IsHeap`             — the min-heap order predicate.
  * `merge_isHeap`, `insert_isHeap`, `popMin?_isHeap` — the operations preserve it.
  * `merge_toList_perm`  — `merge` preserves the multiset (a `List.Perm` from Lean core).
  * `popMin?_perm`       — `popMin?` removes exactly the returned element.
  * `popMin?_is_min`     — in a heap, the popped element is the minimum.

  Mathlib-free: imports nothing outside Lean 4 core `Init`.  `List.Perm` (the `~` notation) and all
  the permutation lemmas used live in core `Init.Data.List.{Basic,Perm}`.

/-! ## The leftist heap -/

/-- A leftist heap: `empty`, or a `node` carrying its `rank` (right-spine length, for `merge`),
    a value, and two child heaps. -/
inductive LHeap where
  | empty : LHeap
  | node (rank : Nat) (v : Int) (l r : LHeap) : LHeap

/-- The empty heap — the starting point for building a heap with `insert`. -/
def empty : LHeap := .empty

/-- The stored rank (`0` for `empty`); the length of the right spine in a genuine leftist heap. -/
def rank : LHeap → Nat
  | .empty => 0
  | .node k _ _ _ => k

/-- Assemble a node from a value and two children, putting the higher-rank child on the left and
    recording the new rank.  This is the O(1) step that keeps the tree leftist. -/
def makeNode (v : Int) (a b : LHeap) : LHeap :=
  if rank a ≥ rank b then .node (rank b + 1) v a b else .node (rank a + 1) v b a

/-- Merge two heaps by walking down the right spines, always keeping the smaller root on top.
    Non-structural (recurses on the right child of one side), so it needs well-founded recursion on
    the total node count. -/

    and the merge of its two children. -/

/-! ## Sanity checks

Kernel `decide`/`rfl` is intentionally NOT used here: `merge` is defined by well-founded recursion,
which does not reduce definitionally, so `decide` on any `merge` result gets stuck.  We evaluate with
the compiler (`#eval`) instead, which runs the extracted code.  The outputs should be sorted. -/
