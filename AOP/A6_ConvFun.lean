  Port of AoPA `Data/List/ConvFunThm.agda`: the converse-of-a-function theorem for list folds,
  in `Rel(Set)`.

  The repo already proves B&dM's relational-fold theory via initial algebras (`relCata`, A5_5 /
  A6_*), so AoPA's powerset fold `foldR R e = ∈ ₁∘ foldr₁ (Λ(R ○ (idR ⨉ ∈))) e` and its fusion law
  are NOT reused here.  Instead the relational list fold is written directly and structurally on
  raw `List` (`foldRrel`), and the theorem is proved by list induction — the fusion detour AoPA
  takes point-free collapses to a two-case induction concretely.

  Statement (AoPA `conv-fun-thm`): if `f : β → List α` satisfies the coalgebra step
      `fun f ○ R ⊑ cons ○ (idR ⨉ fun f)`   (`R ≫ graph f ⊑ (id ⨉ graph f) ≫ cons`)
  and maps the base set `e` into `[]` (`fun f · e ⊆ nil`), then the fold refines `f°`:
      `foldR R e ⊑ (fun f)°`.
