  Bird & de Moor, *Algebra of Programming* §7.3  Planning a company party (book pp. 175-177).

  The party problem (Cormen–Leiserson–Rivest): the company is a tree of employees `tree A =
  node(A, list(tree A))`, each with a conviviality `rating`; choose a guest list maximising total
  rating such that no employee attends with their immediate supervisor.  Formally, maximise
  `max R · Λparty`, where `party = ⦇⟨include, exclude⟩⦈ : list A ← tree A` builds two candidate
  parties (root-in / root-out), `choose = outl ∪ outr` picks one, and `R = (sum·list rating)°·leq·
  (sum·list rating)` orders guest lists by total rating.  The moral (B&dM p.176): this looks like
  dynamic programming but is solved by a GREEDY algorithm.

  Given the two monotonicity claims B&dM leave as exercises — `choose` monotonic on `R`, and
  `⟨include, exclude⟩` monotonic on `R×R` — the greedy theorem (`A7_2.greedy_max`) yields the
  algorithm.  Here we prove the first claim concretely (`choose_monotonic`, a general product
  fact) and state the greedy conclusion as the instance of `greedy_max` it is; the concrete rose
  tree `tree A`, the algebra `⟨include, exclude⟩`, and its monotonicity are the section's remaining
  detail (rose-tree datatype not yet built — see atodo).

    monotonic on `R`, i.e. `choose·(R×R) ⊆ R·choose` (mirrored `(R×R) ≫ choose ⊑ choose ≫ R`).
    Immediate from the product projection laws `prodMap ≫ outl ⊑ outl ≫ R` (and `outr`) and the
    distributivity of composition over `∪`. -/

/-- **§7.3 (B&dM p.176-177)**: the company-party optimisation `max R·Λparty` is solved by a
    GREEDY algorithm.  With `party = ⦇⟨include, exclude⟩⦈` a catamorphism over the employee tree
    and `S = ⟨include, exclude⟩` its algebra, once `S` is monotonic on the transitive rating order
    `R` (B&dM's second claim), the greedy recursion `⦇max R·ΛS⦈` refines the specification
    `max R·Λ⦇S⦈ = max R·Λparty`.  A direct instance of the greedy theorem
    (`A7_2.greedy_max`), whose hypotheses B&dM's monotonicity claims (via `choose_monotonic`
    above and the `⟨include,exclude⟩` calculation p.177) discharge for the concrete tree. -/
