This project explain the book Categories, Allegories of Freyd.

## Directory layout (reorg 2026-07-10) — four Lean lib roots, siblings at repo root
- `Fredy/`  — the Freyd book core: `Sa_bc.lean` book sections + support (`Locale`, `WellOrdering`,
  `RelCat`, `MapCat`, `Slice*`, `Capitalization*`, `Exacts`, …). Modules `Fredy.*`.
- `AOP/`    — the Bird & de Moor Algebra-of-Programming layer: chapter files `A<ch>_*.lean`
  (`A4_*`..`A10_*`) + infra (`A6_GenFold`, `A6_GenHylo`, `A6_ConsList`, `A6_HashMap`, `A6_Heap`,
  `A6_BinSearch`, `A6_1_RelSet`, …) + `Deriv*`. Modules `AOP.*`.
- `leet/`   — LeetCode case studies `L<n>.lean` and derivations `L<n>_derived.lean`. Modules `leet.*`.
- `rel/`    — the relation-algebra interpreter `RelInterp` + case studies (`UnixPipe`, `ShellCommands`)
  + the auto-derivation drivers (`AutoDerive*`). Modules `rel.*`.
- `Fredy/note/` — the author's own `.typ`/`.pdf` section notes and diagrams (non-Lean).
Imports cross libs freely within the one Lake package (e.g. `leet.L20` imports `AOP.A6_GenFold`).
lakefile: `AOP`/`leet`/`rel` are glob'd (all their files are in the default build); `Fredy` keeps the
curated `Fredy.lean` aggregator (no glob — do not force-build the deliberately un-imported orphan core).

You should should any 3+ digits sections of the book into `Fredy/Sa_bc.lean`. e.g. section 1.123 in Fredy/S1_12.lean.
The code should follow the book's terminology, wording, convension.
Write composition in diagram order, by juxtaposition: `xy` means first x then y (the book's convention).
Use the global book notation `𝟙 A` for the categorical identity `Cat.id A`; do not spell identities
as `Cat.id A` in new code.
Always prefer the book's definition over ad-hoc simplifications — even if the
book version requires more typeclasses (e.g., `Entire R := 1_A ≤ R°R` via
`compose` rather than `∃ h, h ≫ R.colA = id_A`).
If a proof used theorem from other section but not defined yet, prove them in $a_bc.lean.
Make the prove constructive: do not use atom of choice unless unavoidable.
feel free to copy ideas from Mathlib, but do not bring in them as dependency.
  STRICTLY MATHLIB-FREE, NO EXCEPTIONS. The repo has ZERO external dependencies:
  `lake-manifest.json` lists no packages and no `Fredy/*.lean` imports anything outside
  Lean 4 core (`Init`) and `Fredy.*`. The §1.543 transfinite-recursion work that once
  earmarked mathlib's ordinals was hand-built instead (`Fredy/WellOrdering.lean`, Zermelo
  from `Classical.choice`); order/lattice/Frame machinery is hand-rolled too (`Locale.lean`,
  `S1_72`). Never add a `require` and never `import Mathlib`/`Batteries`/`Aesop`/`Std` — keep
  the repo self-contained so builds stay fast and clones stay tiny.
DRY as much as possible.

## Book notation pitfalls (OCR drops bold)
- **Follow the book's names strictly.** Never coin your own name for a functor/object and never
  reuse a book symbol for a different thing. In particular `Δ` is the *diagonal* functor `𝐀 → 𝐀/B`
  (book §1.53, [1.44]); the endofunctor `B×−` is the composite `Σ∘Δ` and is **never** written `Δ`.
- **Bold `𝐀` = the category; plain `A`, `B`, … = its objects.** The OCR loses bold, so a category
  `𝐀` shows up as plain `A`. In `𝐀/B` the `𝐀` is the *category* and `B ∈ 𝐀` is an *object* — read it
  as "the category `𝐀` sliced over the object `B`", never "object A over object B".
- **`𝐀/B`: one definition, two presentations; one `Δ`, two readings.** RULE: (1) `𝐀/B` always means
  the full slice — objects are ALL arrows `X → B`, never only the `B×A → B`. (2) `Δ` is the one
  diagonal functor `A ↦ (B×A → B)`, `f ↦ 1×f` (§1.44). §1.544 re-presents the same category over the
  inflation `𝐀'` (objects = finite sequences, product = concatenation, strict cancellation
  `B×A = B×A' ⟹ A = A'`) and renames the image of `Δ` to `𝐀`, making `Δ` injective on objects, so
  `𝐀 ⊆ 𝐀/B` is a subcategory (Freyd's stated purpose) — in force from §1.544 on, needed wherever `𝐀`
  must sit inside `𝐀/B` (capitalization towers and their unions, §1.545–6). Both presentations are
  equivalent categories; slice statements (e.g. §1.63's `Sub` iso) quantify over ALL slice objects.
  (3) On subobjects: `Sub_{𝐀/B}(ΔA) = Sub_𝐀(B×A)`, `Δ` acting by `A' ↦ B×A'` (= `π^#`).
  (4) `Δ` the diagonal *functor* ≠ `⟨1,1⟩` the diagonal *morphism* (§1.535 flags the name clash).
  Factorisation: `(B×−) = Σ∘Δ`, with `Δ: 𝐀 → 𝐀/B` the diagonal
  (`A ↦ (B×A → B)`) and `Σ: 𝐀/B → 𝐀` forgetful (`(X→B) ↦ X`, so `Σ(B×A→B) = B×A`). The §1.53 facts
  Freyd actually proves: Σ preserves/reflects covers & pullbacks, Δ a pre-regular representation,
  Δ faithful iff B well-supported — all argued *directly*, NOT via an adjunction. The adjoint chain
  `Σ ⊣ Δ ⊣ Π` is Freyd's §1.854 (not §1.53), and it IS formalised in Lean: `Σ ⊣ Δ` is
  `sigma_adj_delta` (`S1_85.lean`, axioms `{propext}`, fully constructive; Lean's `Δ` is the mirror
  `Y ↦ ⟨Y×B, snd⟩`), `Δ ⊣ Π` is `sliceForallAdj` (`f* ⊣ Π_f`, `SlicePi.lean`). Σ's §1.531
  preservation/reflection facts are separate (`SliceRegular`/`SliceTopos`).

## Writing explanations / notes
Introduce a concept before its first use. Order sections, paragraphs, and figures so every term, object,
or notation is defined or explained before it appears in another argument. If a later section uses a thing
(e.g. the swap `ℤ/2`-set as a counterexample), the section that says what that thing *is* must come first.
Prefer relative cross-references ("the next subsection", "above") over hard-coded section numbers, which
break when sections are reordered. Avoid unexplained field-specific notation (e.g. `Bℤ/2`, `π₁`); spell it
out ("the one-object category of `ℤ/2`") unless the term has already been introduced.

## Searching the book text
The greppable book prose lives in `/home/dh/anki/typst-book/chapters/<a.b>/section-<a.b>.typ`
(and the `section-*.fixed.md` siblings — cleaned OCR). ALWAYS grep there.
`/home/dh/repo/fredy/book-all.typ` is only a 63-line wrapper that `#include`s those chapter
files — grepping it alone finds NOTHING. To search the whole book:
`grep -rni "<term>" /home/dh/anki/typst-book/chapters/`.
