  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §1.55
  Henkin-Lubkin representation theorem.

  Every small (pre-)regular category is faithfully represented in a power of the
  category of sets.  We model the category of sets 𝒮 as `Type w` with functions
  as morphisms, and a power 𝒮^I as I-indexed families of sets with pointwise
  families of functions.

  The faithful representation is the covariant hom-functor (Cayley, §1.272)
  family `i ↦ Hom(i, -)`: the product functor `𝒞 → 𝒮^|𝒞|`, `A ↦ (i ↦ (i ⟶ A))`,
  separates morphisms because `id_A` distinguishes `f` from `g` (`cayley_faithful`).
  This is constructive and choice-free, so it holds for ANY small category — the
  regularity hypothesis is carried for fidelity to the book but is not used.

  NOTE on scope: this establishes the *faithful* representation of §1.55.  The
  book's construction is additionally *exact* (preserves products, images and
  covers), which is what powers the §1.551 Horn-sentence metatheorem; the
  covariant-hom representation preserves limits but NOT images, so exactness is
  not established here.  An exact faithful representation needs the §1.543
  Capitalization Lemma — now PROVEN Sorry-free as
  `Freyd.capitalization_lemma` (`Freyd/CapDataWiring.lean`, axioms
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).  Only the wiring that APPLIES it
  to upgrade this representation to an exact one remains to be done here.

/-! ## §1.551 Corollary: Horn sentence preservation  — DEFERRED (not stated here)

  §1.551: every Horn sentence in the predicates of regular categories true for the
  category of sets is true for every regular category.  This follows from the
  *exact* form of Henkin-Lubkin, which in turn needs the capitalization lemma
  (`Freyd.capitalization_lemma`, §1.543) — now PROVEN Sorry-free in
  `Freyd/CapDataWiring.lean`.  What remains for §1.551 is the exactness wiring,
  not the capitalization lemma itself.

  It is NOT stated as a theorem here: a faithful statement requires the Horn-sentence
  machinery (`HornSentence`/`HoldsIn`), which lives in `Freyd/S1_56.lean` — and S1_56
  imports this file, so referencing it here would be circular.  The faithful Horn
  reflection statement therefore lives downstream in S1_56
  (`horn_sentence_reflected_by_faithful`, §1.563), proven Sorry-free there as the
  honest content-bearing faithful version.  Per the integrity rule we do NOT emit a
  vacuous `: True` stub for §1.551 here. -/

/-! ## §1.552 Special pre-regular categories

  A pre-regular category A is SPECIAL if every universally quantified sentence in
  the relevant predicates true for S is true for A.

  §1.552 gives two characterizations (both italic in the book). -/

/-! §1.552 FIRST CHARACTERIZATION (elementary subterminator condition):
    A pre-regular category is special iff for every map `f : A → U` into a
    subterminator `U ↣ 1`, either `f` or `U ↣ 1` is an isomorphism. -/

/-- **§1.552 (Char 1)** ELEMENTARY SUBTERMINATOR CONDITION for a pre-regular category.
    The category is SPECIAL (§1.552) iff this holds.
    Equivalence with specialness (the universally-quantified sentences condition) uses
    the capitalization lemma (§1.543), proven Sorry-free as `Freyd.capitalization_lemma`. -/
def IsSpecialPreReg (𝒞 : Type u) [Cat.{w} 𝒞] [HasTerminal 𝒞] : Prop :=
  ∀ {A U : 𝒞} (f : A ⟶ U), Subterminator U → IsIso f ∨ IsIso (term U)

/-! §1.552 SECOND CHARACTERIZATION:
    A pre-regular category is special iff it is
      • one-valued (|π₀ A| = 1: every subterminator is isomorphic to 1), or
      • two-valued (|π₀ A| = 2: unique proper subterminator 0) and every object
        is either well-supported (A → 1 is a cover) or isomorphic to 0. -/

/-- **§1.552 (Char 2 ←, one-valued case)**: a one-valued Cartesian category satisfies
    the subterminator condition.  Every subterminator `U` already has `IsIso (term U)`
    by one-valuedness, so the second disjunct fires unconditionally. -/
theorem special552_oneValued (𝒞 : Type u) [Cat.{w} 𝒞] [CartesianCategory 𝒞]
    (h1v : OneValued (𝒞 := 𝒞)) : IsSpecialPreReg 𝒞 :=
  fun _f hU => Or.inr (h1v _ hU)

/-- **§1.552 (Char 2 ←, two-valued case)**: a two-valued Cartesian category satisfies
    the subterminator condition.

    Proof: given `f : A → U` with `Subterminator U`:
    • if `IsIso (term U)`, the second disjunct holds;
    • otherwise `term U` is proper, so `zero_uniq` gives `e : U ≅ zeroObj`;
      then `f ≫ e : A → zeroObj` is iso by `zero_strict`, and since `e` is iso,
      `f = (f ≫ e) ≫ e⁻¹` is iso (first disjunct).

    Note: the "every object well-supported or ≅ 0" clause belongs to the CONVERSE
    direction (that `IsSpecialPreReg` forces the well-supported-or-zero partition in
    the two-valued case), which requires the exact Henkin-Lubkin representation and
    is left as a TODO below. -/

    obtain ⟨e_inv, he1, he2⟩ := he_iso

    have hf_eq : f = (f ≫ e) ≫ e_inv := by rw [Cat.assoc, he1, Cat.comp_id]
    exact Or.inl (hf_eq ▸ isIso_comp hfe_iso ⟨e, he2, he1⟩)

/-- **§1.552 (strict coterminator consequence):** in a special pre-regular category, every
    PROPER subterminator `U` (with `¬ IsIso (term U)`) is a STRICT COTERMINATOR — every map
    `f : A → U` is an isomorphism.

    Proof: `IsSpecialPreReg` gives `IsIso f ∨ IsIso (term U)`; since `term U` is not iso
    the first disjunct holds.  This is the direction `IsSpecialPreReg ⟹ strict-coterminator`
    of §1.552, provable directly from the elementary subterminator condition. -/
theorem special552_proper_subterminator_strict {𝒞 : Type u} [Cat.{w} 𝒞] [HasTerminal 𝒞]
    (hsp : IsSpecialPreReg 𝒞)
    {U : 𝒞} (hSub : Subterminator U) (hprop : ¬ IsIso (term U))
    {A : 𝒞} (f : A ⟶ U) : IsIso f :=
  (hsp f hSub).resolve_right hprop

/-- **§1.552 (two-valued well-supported-or-zero):** in a two-valued special pre-regular
    category with images, every object `A` is either WELL-SUPPORTED (`A → 1` is a cover)
    or isomorphic to `0` (the unique proper subterminator).

    Proof: let `S = image(term A)`, a subterminator.  Apply `IsSpecialPreReg` to
    `image.lift(term A) : A → S.dom`:
    • If `IsIso (image.lift (term A))` and `IsIso S.arr`: image of `term A` is entire,
      so `WellSupported A`.
    • If `IsIso (image.lift (term A))` and `¬ IsIso S.arr`: `S.arr` is a proper mono
      (it IS `term S.dom` by `term_uniq`), so `TwoValued.zero_uniq` gives `S.dom ≅ 0`;
      composing gives `A ≅ 0`.
    • If `IsIso (term S.dom)` (second disjunct): then `S.arr = term S.dom` is iso, so
      image of `term A` is entire, i.e., `WellSupported A`.

    Note: `HasImages` is required to factor `term A` through its image.  The full
    equivalence `IsSpecialPreReg ↔ special (universally-quantified sentences)` uses the
    capitalization lemma (`Freyd.capitalization_lemma`, §1.543, proven Sorry-free) to wire
    in the (⟹) direction; that syntactic-apparatus wiring is deferred as a
