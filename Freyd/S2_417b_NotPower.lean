  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.417 — Target 3.
  "A generator (as opposed to a progenitor) is not good enough."

  §2.417 concludes: `Rel(C)` HAS a generator (§2.417 target 2, `S2_417_Generator.lean`)
  but is NOT a power allegory, because — "just as in [1.96(10)]" — the ONLY object of `C`
  with a power-object is the COTERMINATOR (the initial object `O`).  By §2.414, `Rel(C)`
  is a power allegory iff `Map(Rel C) = C` is a topos iff EVERY object of `C` has a
  power-object; so a non-coterminator lacking a power-object refutes the power allegory.

  This file supplies the reachable, hole-free core of that conclusion:

    (1)  A faithful CONCRETE power-object condition in `Rel(C)` (`IsPowerObj`), phrased with
         the file's own equivariant relations `CRel` (§2.41/§1.9 universal property): `mem`
         is a power-object of `X` iff every equivariant relation `R : A → X` factors as
         `A(R) ⊚ mem` for a UNIQUE `C`-map `A(R) : A → P`.  `HasPowerObj X` bundles ∃P,mem.

    (2)  `RelCIsPowerAllegory := ∀ X, HasPowerObj X` — the concrete §2.414 content of
         "`Rel(C)` is a power allegory".  Target 3 is `¬ RelCIsPowerAllegory`.

    (3)  `singleton_of_power` — §2.415: a power-object yields the SINGLETON MAP `{·}:X → [X]`
         with `x ∈ {y} ⟺ x = y` (the classifier of the diagonal).  A genuine necessary
         consequence of `IsPowerObj`, true independent of any topos structure.

    (4)  `coterminator_hasPowerObject` — the POSITIVE half of §2.417's dichotomy: the
         coterminator `O` (empty carrier) DOES have a power-object, namely the terminator
         with the empty membership relation.  (Every relation into `O` is empty, so `Rel(-,O)`
         is represented by the terminator.)

  REACHABILITY VERDICT on the NEGATIVE half `¬ RelCIsPowerAllegory` (see trailing comment):
  it is NOT faithfully reachable over a FIXED label type `L`.  Freyd's §1.96(10) collapse is
  driven by "for all `s` in the universe" — the label universe is a PROPER CLASS; the map
  condition ranging over it is what kills power-objects of non-initial objects.  The
  `variable {L : Type}` encoding replaces that proper class by a SET, and over a set the
  collapse mechanism disappears (for `|L| ≤ 1`, `C` is literally the presheaf topos of a
  single endofunction, which HAS all power-objects and IS a power allegory).  Reaching
  target 3 needs a re-encoding of `C` with an unbounded label universe — a different file.

/-! ## §2.41  A concrete power-object in `Rel(C)`

  A morphism of `Rel(C)` is an equivariant relation (`CRel`, `S2_417_Generator.lean`).
  A MAP of `Rel(C)` (an entire single-valued relation) is the graph of a `C`-morphism
  `CHom`.  Precomposing the graph of `g : A → P` into `mem : P → X` gives the relation
  `(graph g ⊚ mem).rel a x = mem.rel (g a) x`.  Freyd's §2.41 universal property for the
  power-object `[X] = P` with membership `∋_X = mem` reads: every equivariant relation
  `R : A → X` equals `A(R) ⊚ mem` for a UNIQUE `C`-map `A(R) = g`. -/

/-- **§2.41 concrete power-object.**  `mem : P → X` is a power-object of `X` in `Rel(C)`:
    for every object `A` and every equivariant relation `R : A → X` there is a unique
    `C`-map `g : A → P` with `R = graph g ⊚ mem`, i.e. `R.rel a x ↔ mem.rel (g x) x`. -/

  ## Target 3 — the negative half `¬ RelCIsPowerAllegory` — REACHABILITY GAP.

  Freyd's §1.96(10)/§2.417 collapse ("only the coterminator has a power-object") is powered
  by the map condition quantifying over ALL labels `a` "in the universe" — a PROPER CLASS.
  The `variable {L : Type}` encoding fixes `L` as a SET.  Over a set the collapse fails:

    * `|L| ≤ 1`: `C` is the category of a single endofunction (`x ↦ x^a`) with equivariant
      maps = the presheaf topos `[Bℕ, Set]`, which HAS all power-objects — so `RelCIsPowerAllegory`
      HOLDS and `¬ RelCIsPowerAllegory` is FALSE there.
    * general fixed `L`: the per-object active set `A ⊆ L` adds cross-label constraints, so `C`
      is not simply a presheaf topos, but there is no size/universe obstruction of the §1.96(10)
      kind, so a general refutation is not available (and would be UNSOUND for small `L`).

  A faithful `¬ RelCIsPowerAllegory` therefore requires re-encoding `C` with an unbounded /
  proper-class label universe (matching "for all `s` in the universe").  That is a separate
  formalization; asserting the negation here for fixed `L` would be false-with-a-hole, which
  this file deliberately avoids.  What IS proved: the concrete power-object universal property,
  the §2.415 singleton map it forces, and the positive half (coterminator has a power-object).
