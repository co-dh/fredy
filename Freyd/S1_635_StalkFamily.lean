  §1.635 — the STALK FAMILY collective conservativity (toward §2.218).

  Freyd represents a capital positive pre-logos in a POWER of `Set` via the family of stalks
  `{T_F̂}` over ultra-filters `F̂` of complemented subterminators.  The family is COLLECTIVELY
  faithful (Freyd §1.635:239-253): given a proper subobject, SOME ultra-filter's stalk keeps it
  proper.  No single stalk reflects isos — that needs full well-pointedness, which the
  capitalization does NOT give; the family does not.

  This file builds the collective-conservativity ingredients.  First brick: the stalk evaluated
  on a SUBTERMINATOR `V` is inhabited iff `V` is in the filter (`TF_subterminator_nonempty`) —
  the bridge between the geometric "stalk" and the combinatorial "ultra-filter membership" that
  Freyd's separation argument turns on. -/

/-- **Stalk of a subterminator = filter membership.**  For a FILTER `ℱ` (upward-closed) and a
    subterminator `V : Subobject 𝒞 one`, the stalk `T_ℱ(V.dom)` is inhabited iff `V ∈ ℱ`.

    `←`: `V ∈ ℱ` names the identity `V.dom → V.dom`.  `→`: a name `a : U.dom → V.dom` with `U ∈ ℱ`
    forces `U ≤ V` (both `U.dom, V.dom` map uniquely to the terminator `one`, so `a ≫ V.arr =
    U.arr`), and upward-closure lifts `U ∈ ℱ` to `V ∈ ℱ`. -/

/-- **§1.635 detection at the stalk level.**  A PROPER complemented subterminator `V` (≠ `1`) is
    killed by SOME ultra-filter stalk: there is an ultra-filter `ℱ` with `T_ℱ(V.dom)` EMPTY.

    This is `exists_ultrafilter_excluding` (§1.635:253) read through the stalk: the excluding
    ultra-filter omits `V`, and a name `U.dom → V.dom` from a member `U ∈ ℱ` would force `V ∈ ℱ`
    (`ultrafilter_isFilter` up-closure to the complemented `V`), a contradiction. -/

/-- **§1.635:253 — the RELATIVE ultra-filter construction.**  Given a complemented subterminator
    `U` and a sub `Usub ≤ U` that does NOT exhaust `U` (`¬ U ≤ Usub`), there is an ultra-filter `ℱ`
    that CONTAINS `U` yet omits every complemented `V ≤ Usub`.

    Freyd's `F = {W ∈ ℬ | U ≤ Usub ∪ W}` (a proper pre-filter — proper exactly because
    `¬ U ≤ Usub`, ↓-directed by `meetJoin_le`); extend to an ultra-filter `ℱ`.  Then `U ∈ ℱ`, and a
    complemented `V ≤ Usub` is excluded because its complement `Vᶜ ∈ F ⊆ ℱ` (as `Usub ∪ Vᶜ ⊇ V∪Vᶜ =
    1 ⊇ U`), so `V ∈ ℱ` would put `V ∩ Vᶜ ≤ 0` in `ℱ`, against properness.

    This is strictly more than `exists_ultrafilter_excluding` (`Usub = ` a complemented `V ⊊ 1`); it
    is what detects a proper subobject probed by a complemented subterminator. -/
