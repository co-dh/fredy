  Mathlib-free well-ordering theorem (Zermelo), from `Classical.choice`.

  ## Why this file exists

  Freyd §1.543's last open obligation `hwall_cap` reduces (Freyd/CapitalizationTransfinite.lean) to a
  *cofinal* points-acquisition: the successor tower must point EVERY well-supported object of the
  colimit.  A strict `Colim.CatSystem` transition forces the index to be a LINEAR chain, so a countable
  ℕ-chain reaches only countably many objects.  Pointing an uncountable object type `A : Type u`
  cofinally needs an UNCOUNTABLE linearly-ordered cofinal family — i.e. a WELL-ORDER of the objects,
  with limit stages formed as the generic directed `Colim.Colimit`.

  mathlib supplies `WellOrderingRel` / Zermelo's theorem, but the repo is deliberately mathlib-free.
  This file proves Zermelo from core Lean's `Classical.choice` ALONE, so the index type of
  `Freyd.Colim.Directed` / `Freyd.Inflation.OrdChain` can be any type, mathlib-free.

  ## What is proved

  * `IsWellOrder r`           — `r : α → α → Prop` is irreflexive, transitive, trichotomous, and
                                well-founded (every nonempty predicate has an `r`-least witness).
  * `exists_wellOrder α`      — Zermelo: `∃ r, IsWellOrder r` for every type `α`.
  * `IsWellOrder.least`       — least element of any nonempty predicate (the cofinal-enumeration engine).
  * `IsWellOrder.toDirected`  — a well-order is a `Freyd.Colim.Directed` (`bound = max`), ready to index
                                `OrdChain`/`CatSystem`.

  ## Method

  Zorn-free "g-tower" route (Zermelo 1904 / Bourbaki).  We develop the tiny amount of order theory we
  need (sets as predicates, initial segments) inline.  See `exists_wellOrder` for the construction.

/-! ## The well-order, bundled

We target a usable strict order: irreflexive, transitive, trichotomous (any two distinct elements are
comparable), and well-founded via a *least-element* operator on nonempty predicates.  Trichotomy +
well-foundedness give a genuine well-order. -/

/-- `r` is a well-order on `α`: a strict order (irreflexive, transitive), trichotomous, and every
    inhabited predicate `p` has an `r`-least witness.  This is the form the cofinal-enumeration engine
    of §1.543 consumes (it needs to repeatedly take the least not-yet-pointed object). -/

/-! ## Zermelo's construction

Fix a choice function `g : Sub α → α` that, on any set whose complement is inhabited, returns an element
*outside* it.  We build the well-order from `g`-towers.

The clean non-Zorn formulation (Zermelo / Bourbaki): consider sets `s : Sub α` equipped with a relation
making them well-ordered such that every element `x ∈ s` is `g` of its own strict-down-set within `s`.
Any two such "`g`-well-ordered sets" are comparable (one is an initial segment of the other), and their
union is again one and is `g`-closed, hence must be all of `α` — else `g (union)` would extend it.  We
encode "`x = g (down-set of x)`" *intrinsically* through the order, avoiding a separately-carried
relation, by working with the family of `g`-closed initial-segment systems.

We phrase it via **attainable sets**: `t : Sub α` is *attainable* when it is `g`-inductive, i.e. closed
and built up by `g` on initial segments.  We then read the order off inclusion of down-sets. -/

/-! ### Bourbaki–Witt towers

Fix `g : Sub α → α`.  The *successor* of a set `s` is `succ s = s ∪ {g s}`.  A **tower** is any set
reachable from `∅` by iterating `succ` and taking unions of sub-collections.  We show towers form a
chain (any two are `⊆`-comparable) and are `succ`-closed, which is the Bourbaki–Witt fixpoint engine. -/

/-! #### Comparability (Bourbaki–Witt chain lemma)

A tower `c` is **narrow** if every tower `s ⊆ c` is either `c` itself or has `succ s ⊆ c` (i.e. `c`
admits no tower strictly between `s` and `succ s`).  We prove every tower is narrow, and that narrow
towers are comparable with all towers; hence any two towers are `⊆`-comparable. -/

  ∀ s, Tower g s → s ⊆ₛ c → s = c ∨ succ g s ⊆ₛ c

/-! ## Downstream plumbing (independent of the Zermelo proof)

These show that ONCE `IsWellOrder r` is available, it feeds the existing §1.543 machinery directly:
`least` is the cofinal-enumeration engine, and `toDirected` packages the order as a `Colim.Directed`
index (bound = the `r`-max of two elements, which exists by trichotomy).  Both are Sorry-free, so the
ONLY thing standing between mathlib-free §1.543 and a closed `hwall_cap` is `exists_wellOrder`. -/

/-- A well-order is a directed preorder for `Colim.Directed`, using the reflexive closure `r a b ∨ a = b`
    as `le` and the `r`-greater of `i j` as the common bound.  This is the index a transfinite
    `OrdChain`/`CatSystem` consumes — so a well-order on the object type drives the cofinal outer tower
    with limit stages = the generic `Colim.Colimit`. -/

/-! ## Zorn's lemma (mathlib-free), from the Bourbaki–Witt tower engine

  The same `Tower`/`bigU` machinery yields Zorn directly, with NO well-order detour.  We phrase it
  for a type `T` carrying a preorder `le` in which every `le`-CHAIN (a `⊆`-set of pairwise comparable
  points) has an upper bound: then `T` has a `le`-maximal element.

  Construction (standard).  Fix a default `d : T` and a choice function `g : Sub T → T` that, on a
  set `s` admitting a *strict* upper bound, returns one; else returns an arbitrary upper bound of `s`
  (which exists by the chain hypothesis once `s` is a chain).  Every tower is then a chain (induction
  on the tower: `succ s = s ∪ {g s}` stays a chain because `g s` is `≥` every element of the chain
  `s`).  Hence `bigU` is a chain, so it has an upper bound `b`.  And `b` is maximal: if some `c > b`
  then `g bigU` is a strict upper bound of `bigU`, so `g bigU ∉ bigU` (it is `>` every member),
  contradicting `g_bigU_mem`. -/

/-- **Zorn's lemma (mathlib-free).**  If every `le`-chain in `T` has an upper bound (and `le` is
    reflexive), then `T` has a `le`-maximal element: some `m` such that no `c` is strictly `> m`
    (i.e. `le m c ∧ le c m` for every `c` with `le m c`).

    PROOF.  `bigU` (for `g = zg le d`) is a tower, hence a chain (`zg_tower_chain`); by the chain
    hypothesis it has an upper bound `m`.  `m` is maximal: were there `c` with `le m c` but not
    `le c m`, then `m` itself extends to a strict upper bound `c` of `bigU` (since `m` already bounds
    `bigU`), so `bigU` has a strict upper bound and `g bigU := zg le d bigU` is one
    (`zg_strict`).  But `g bigU ∈ bigU` (`g_bigU_mem`), so applying the strictness clause to
    `b := g bigU` (an upper bound, with `le (g bigU)(g bigU)` by reflexivity) yields `False`. -/
