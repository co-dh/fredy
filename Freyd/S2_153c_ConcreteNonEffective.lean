  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories, Allegories* §2.153 — the CONCRETE non-effectiveness
  headline over the RECURSIVE modulus system `Krec`.

  `Freyd/S2_153_NonEffective.lean` proves the REDUCTION
  `asmReflection_not_ac_of_nonsplitting`: a non-splitting equivalence relation `I`
  (in the allegory `Rel(Assembly K)`) on some assembly `A` over `K` gives
  `¬ CoversSplit (AsmEffReflection K)`.  `Freyd/S2_153b_RecursiveModulus.lean`
  supplies the concrete recursive modulus system `Krec` (`mem := PartRec`).

  This file supplies the missing bridge and the concrete witness.

  ## The bridge (this section, hole-free)

  `asmReflection_not_ac_of_binRel_not_effective`: the assembly mirror of the recursive
  category's `Freyd.RecEff.no_splitsAsMap` (`Freyd/S2_16_Recursive.lean`), lifted to a
  reusable reduction.  For ANY assembly `A` over `Krec` and ANY category-level (§1.56)
  BinRel-equivalence-relation `E : BinRel (Assembly Krec) A A` that is NOT EFFECTIVE
  (`¬ IsEffective E`, §1.568 — not the level of any cover), the effective reflection
  `E = Spl(Eq (Rel(Assembly Krec)))` (§2.16(14)) fails AC.

  The proof is the exact transport of `Freyd.RecEff.no_splitsAsMap` through the graph
  embedding `Assembly Krec ↪ Map(Rel(Assembly Krec))` (all lemmas generic over a regular
  category, `Assembly Krec` regular by §2.153 `asmRegular`):
  * `I := relClass E` is an equivalence relation of `Rel(Assembly Krec)` — reflexive,
    symmetric, transitive — because `E` is one at the BinRel level (`quotLe_iff_algLe`,
    `qComp_mk`, `qRecip_mk`, mirroring `eE_refl`/`eE_sym`/`eE_idem`).
  * A hypothetical map-splitting `f` of `I` is, by fullness of the graph embedding
    (`embedRel_full`, §2.148 dual), the class `[graph g]` of an assembly morphism `g`;
    then `f ≫ f° = I` says `graph g ⊚ (graph g)° ≈ E` and `f° ≫ f = 1` says `g` is a
    COVER (`cover_iff_one_le_reciprocal_comp_self`, §1.569) — i.e. exactly `IsEffective E`,
    which `hne` forbids.  So no splitting exists, and
    `asmReflection_not_ac_of_nonsplitting` fires.

  ## The concrete witness (Layers 3–4) — CLOSED in `S2_153f` (see the corrected note below)

  With the bridge above, the literal §2.153 headline `¬ CoversSplit (AsmEffReflection Krec)`
  reduces to exhibiting ONE concrete instance

      ∃ (A : Assembly Krec) (E : BinRel (Assembly Krec) A A),
        EquivalenceRelation E ∧ ¬ IsEffective E

  and then applying `asmReflection_not_ac_of_binRel_not_effective`.  This is the genuine
  hard core of §2.153; it is NOT a transport of §1.572b's `ERel` (see below).

  ### Why `¬ IsEffective E` is the hard part — the structural obstruction

  In `Assembly Krec`, the level (kernel pair) `graph x ⊚ (graph x)°` of ANY cover
  `x : A → Q` has, as a BinRel on `A`, a caucus structure INDEPENDENT of `Q`: the
  composite tabulation is built from the pullback of `graph x` against itself, whose
  legs are `1_A` (a `graph`'s `colA`), so a pullback point over `(a,a')` with `x a = x a'`
  is realized purely by an `A×A`-realizer `code (r_a) (r_a')` (`r_a` a caucus index of `a`
  in `A`), never by a `Q`-realizer.  Hence for every cover `x` realizing a given set-kernel,

      graph x ⊚ (graph x)°  ≅  Ā_E   (the FULL A×A-induced realizability on E's set),

  where `Ā_E|ₘ = {(a,a') ∈ E-set : a ∈ A|_{ℓm}, a' ∈ A|_{ϰm}}`.  Therefore, for an
  equivalence relation `E`,

      IsEffective E  ⟺  relClass E = relClass Ā_E  ⟺  the "fill" map Ā_E → E is Krec-tracked.

  Non-effectiveness is thus: the fill — recovering an `E`-realizer of `(a,a')` from the
  CHEAP point-realizers `code (r_a) (r_a')` — is NOT `Krec`-partial-recursive.  The §2.153
  witness makes that fill DECIDE `Kc`: build `A` with non-singleton, `Kc`-driven caucuses so
  that `E` glues `2e ~ 2e+1` realized only by a halting witness for `e`, while `A`'s point
  realizers are cheap; a fill modulus, being TOTAL on the inhabited caucus index of every
  glued pair, would give a total `Krec`-decider of `Kc`, contradicting
  `Freyd.Rcat.K_not_recursive`.

  ### Why the naive singleton route FAILS (do not use it)

  On the singleton-caucus assembly (`A|ₙ = {n}`) EVERY equivalence relation is effective:
  the canonical quotient `Q|ₙ := {[a] : a ∈ A|ₙ}`, `x a := [a]`, is a `Krec`-cover tracked
  by the identity modulus with kernel exactly `E`.  So `¬ IsEffective E` is FALSE there and
  the halting relation does not qualify — the caucuses must be `Kc`-driven and non-singleton.

  ### Remaining Lean work — CLOSED in `S2_153f` (and the prediction above corrected)

  The concrete `A`/`E` is supplied by `Freyd/S2_153f_ParityWitness.lean`: `A = ∇ℕ`, `E` the
  parity relation (classes `2k ~ 2k+1`, caucus at `m` = diagonal ∪ classes ≤ m).  The
  structural obstruction described above is right that the level's caucuses are `Q`-independent
  (`level_caucus_iff`, `S2_153e`), but the prediction that the fill must "DECIDE `Kc`" was
  wrong: over `∇ℕ` the cheap index carries NO information about the pair, so a single tracked
  index already contradicts the class-bounded caucuses — UNIFORMITY OF NAMING, no recursion
  theory, valid over `Krec` and over `allPartial` alike.

/-! ## The bridge: BinRel non-effectiveness ⟹ the reflection fails AC

  This is the assembly analogue of `Freyd.RecEff.no_splitsAsMap` +
  `Freyd.RecEff.reflection_not_ac`, packaged to accept the category-level (§1.56)
  witness `¬ IsEffective E` directly. -/

/-- **§2.153 / §2.16(13) for assemblies over `Krec` — the BinRel reduction.**  For an
    assembly `A` over `Krec` and a §1.56 BinRel-equivalence-relation `E : A → A` that is
    NOT the level of any cover (`¬ IsEffective E`), the effective reflection of
    `Rel(Assembly Krec)` is not an allegory of choice: covers do not all split there.

    This reduces the concrete §2.153 non-effectiveness to a single category-theoretic
    obligation about assemblies over `Krec`, in exactly the shape of the recursive
    category's `Freyd.RecEff.reflection_not_ac` (whose witness is `ERel_not_effective`). -/
