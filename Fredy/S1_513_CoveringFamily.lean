  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §1.513–§1.514.

  §1.513  COVERING FAMILY.  A collection of morphisms `{Aᵢ → B}` with a common
  target COVERS if no proper subobject of `B` allows all of them.  This is the
  family generalization of the single-morphism `Cover` of §1.512 (`S1_51.lean`):
  `Cover f` is exactly `CoveringFamily` of the one-element family.

  §1.514  EPIC FAMILY.  A collection `{Aᵢ → B}` is EPIC if the maps collectively
  cancel (a monic family in the opposite category).  In a category with
  equalizers, COVER implies EPIC — the family version of §1.512's `cover_epi`,
  argued directly through the equalizer subobject.

/-! ## §1.513  Covering family

  Reuses the §1.51 `Subobject` / `Allows` / `Subobject.IsEntire` machinery.
  A family `f : ∀ i, A i ⟶ B` COVERS `B` when every subobject that allows all
  of the `f i` is entire — i.e. no *proper* subobject allows all of them. -/

def CoveringFamily {ι : Type} {A : ι → 𝒞} {B : 𝒞} (f : ∀ i, A i ⟶ B) : Prop :=
  ∀ S : Subobject 𝒞 B, (∀ i, Allows S (f i)) → S.IsEntire

/-- The single-morphism `Cover` (§1.512) is exactly `CoveringFamily` of the
    one-element (`Unit`-indexed) family.  Both say: any subobject through which
    the morphism(s) factor is entire. -/

/-! ## §1.514  Epic family, and cover ⟹ epic

  A family `f : ∀ i, A i ⟶ B` is EPIC (jointly right-cancellable) if any two
  maps out of `B` agreeing after every `f i` are equal. -/

def EpicFamily {ι : Type} {A : ι → 𝒞} {B : 𝒞} (f : ∀ i, A i ⟶ B) : Prop :=
  ∀ {Y : 𝒞} (g h : B ⟶ Y), (∀ i, f i ≫ g = f i ≫ h) → g = h

/-- The equalizer inclusion `eqMap g h : E ⟶ B` is monic: two maps into `E`
    agreeing after it are both the equalizer lift of the same cone, hence equal.
    (Proved locally to keep this file's imports minimal — cf. `eqMap_mono'`.) -/

  rw [hp, hq]

/-- **§1.514.**  In a category with equalizers, a COVERING family is EPIC.
    If `g, h : B ⟶ Y` agree after every `f i`, they factor through the
    equalizer subobject `e : E ↣ B`; each `f i` factors through `e` (via the
    equalizer lift), so the covering condition forces `e` iso, and `e ≫ g = e ≫ h`
    then cancels to `g = h`. -/

  -- The equalizer of g, h as a subobject of B.
  let S : Subobject 𝒞 B := ⟨eqObj g h, eqMap g h, eqMap_monic g h⟩
  -- Every `f i` factors through the equalizer (it equalizes g, h by `hgh`).
  have hallows : ∀ i, Allows S (f i) :=
    fun i => ⟨eqLift g h (f i) (hgh i), eqLift_fac g h (f i) (hgh i)⟩
  -- Covering ⟹ the equalizer inclusion is iso.
  obtain ⟨einv, _, hinv⟩ := hf S hallows
  -- `e ≫ g = e ≫ h`; cancel the (now invertible) `e = eqMap g h` on the left.
  calc g = (einv ≫ eqMap g h) ≫ g := by rw [hinv, Cat.id_comp]
