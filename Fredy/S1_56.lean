/-! ## §1.563 Modular identity

  In a regular category: RS ∩ T ⊆ (R ∩ TS°)S.
  This is one of the defining axioms of allegories (§2).

  **Provability:** Not provable from the `BinRel` definition alone (jointly-monic
  pair + pullback/image composition).  In **Set**, the modular identity holds by
  element-wise reasoning — the standard proof constructs witnesses `y` from
  membership in RS ∩ T.  Freyd's strategy (§1.55, the Henkin-Lubkin
  representation theorem) faithfully embeds any small pre-regular category in a
  power of Set, and faithful representations reflect the modular identity back
  to the original category.  So it becomes a theorem after the representation is
  established, but not before. -/

/-! ## §1.563 Horn-sentence reflection

  **First paragraph of §1.563** (stated without proof in the book): if A and B are
  Cartesian categories with images and F : A → B preserves the Cartesian structure
  and images, then the induced functions Rel(A,B) → Rel(FA,FB) preserve composition,
  reciprocation and intersection; if F is faithful, it also reflects them.

  *Why the book omits the proof.*  Both halves are routine — but only because the
  difficulty was paid for earlier:

  - *Preservation* is mechanical: each operation is constructed from exactly the
    structure F preserves.  A relation is a jointly-monic table into A×B (products,
    monics — preserved since pullbacks are); reciprocation composes with the twist
    iso A×B ≅ B×A (products); intersection is a pullback of subobjects; composition
    is pullback-of-B-legs followed by image.  F preserves every ingredient of each
    recipe, hence the result — a canonical-iso chase with no ideas in it.

  - *Reflection* hinges on the book's definition of FAITHFUL (§1.33): an embedding
    that reflects isomorphisms — strictly stronger than hom-injectivity (`Faithful`
    in `S1_33` follows the book).  Any equation between relation-expressions says a
    canonical comparison monic is iso; F preserves the constructions, so if the
    equation holds downstairs the comparison is iso there, and "reflects isos" pulls
    it back.  §1.453 (faithful iff properness of subobjects is preserved) is the
    load-bearing bridge.  Freyd announces the heuristic at §1.33: "almost any
    property of interest is reflected by faithful functors that preserve it."

  - With the *modern* (merely hom-injective) notion of faithful, reflection is
    FALSE: for A = the poset 2 = {0 < 1}, B = the terminal category, the unique
    functor F is hom-injective and trivially preserves products, pullbacks and
    images, yet F(0) = F(1) as relations on 1 while 0 ∩ 1 = 0 ≠ 1 in A.  This is
    why these theorems must use `Faithful` from `S1_33`, not hom-injectivity.

  The first paragraph is the concrete, operation-by-operation instance of the
  Horn-sentence metatheorem below, and the natural stepping stone to proving it.

  A HORN SENTENCE in the predicates of (pre-)regular categories is treated
  abstractly here (its syntax is developed in §1.55); `HoldsIn H 𝒟` says the
  sentence `H` is satisfied by the category `𝒟`. -/

    functor preserving finite limits and images, then F reflects any Horn sentence
    in the language of Cartesian categories with images.  In particular, the
    modular identity (being a Horn sentence) holds in A iff it holds in B. -/

  A PUSHOUT is a pullback in the opposite category: given f: C→A, g: C→B,
  a pushout is P with maps A→P, B→P universal among cocones. -/

/-! ## §1.565 Pullback of covers is a pushout

  In a regular category, if both legs of a pullback square are covers,
  then the square is also a pushout.

  Freyd's proof: form the relation R = p₁°a ∩ p₂°b, verify it is a map in
  **Set** by element-wise reasoning, then use the Henkin-Lubkin
  representation theorem (§1.55) to transfer the result to any regular
  category. -/

/-- **§1.565 for Set**: A pullback of surjective functions is a pushout in **Set**.

    ```
    The square commutes: `p₁ ≫ u = p₂ ≫ v`, i.e., `∀ z, u(p₁ z) = v(p₂ z)`.

    Pushout universal property: for any Q, a: A→Q, b: C→Q with
    `p₁ ≫ a = p₂ ≫ b` (i.e., `∀ z, a(p₁ z) = b(p₂ z)`), there exists a
    unique h: B→Q with `u ≫ h = a` and `v ≫ h = b`
