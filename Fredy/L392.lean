  LeetCode 392 — Is Subsequence — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given two strings `s` and `t` (here `List Int`, one code point per element), decide
  whether `s` is a SUBSEQUENCE of `t` — i.e. `s` can be obtained from `t` by deleting some
  (possibly zero) elements without reordering the rest.

  A DECISION problem (Skill S5), but on TWO inputs at once (Skill S16/S21): the program is a
  two-argument greedy match, and — unlike most decision problems here, whose honest spec is a
  hand-rolled Prop mirror of the program — the honest specification is Lean CORE's
  `List.Sublist` (`<+`, Skill S24): the multiplicity-and-order-faithful subsequence relation
  (`⊆`/`List.Subset` is a faithfulness BUG here — it forgets order and multiplicity, so
  `[1,1] ⊆ [1]` is vacuously true).

  1. **Program** — `isSubseqFn s t`: `[]` is a subsequence of anything; a nonempty `s` is never a
     subsequence of `[]`; otherwise compare the heads — if they match, consume BOTH heads and
     recurse; if not, only `t`'s head is skipped and `s` waits.  Every recursive call strictly
     shrinks `t` (both branches of the last case replace `b :: t'` by `t'`), so this is ordinary
     STRUCTURAL recursion on the second argument, not well-founded recursion — no fuel needed.

  2. **Specification** — `s <+ t` (`List.Sublist`), Lean core's own subsequence relation, built
     from `slnil`/`cons`/`cons₂`.

  3. **Correctness** — `subseq_correct : isSubseqFn s t = true ↔ s <+ t`, by `induction t
     generalizing s` (Skill S16's two-input shape) then `cases s`.  The two live cases both reduce
     to a Lean-core Sublist lemma at the SAME head: `a = b` uses `cons_sublist_cons` (`a::s' <+
     a::t' ↔ s' <+ t'`); `a ≠ b` uses `sublist_cons_iff` (`l <+ b::t' ↔ l <+ t' ∨ ∃ r, l = b::r ∧ r
     <+ t'`), whose second disjunct is ruled out by `a ≠ b` via `injection`.  No hand-rolled
     Sublist reasoning at all — Lean core already has exactly the lemmas this recurrence needs.

  4. **`Rel(Set)` packaging** — `solve := graph (fun p => isSubseqFn p.1 p.2) : dInput ⟶ dBool`
     (a `Map`), `spec : dInput ⟶ dBool := fun p b => (b = true ↔ p.1 <+ p.2)`, and `solve = spec`
     (Skill S5's bool-extensionality route, `bool_eq_of_iff_true`).

  Mathlib-free; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} (the correctness proof is pure `List Int` /
  `List.Sublist` reasoning — no `Classical.choice` anywhere).
