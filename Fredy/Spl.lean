  WHY §2.165/§2.166 are TODO:

  For `R : E ⟶ F` in `SplObj 𝒜` (with `E = ⟨a, e⟩`, `F = ⟨b, f⟩`), the natural
  candidate legs `P := ⟨e ≫ p, ...⟩ : E ⟶ embObj c` and `Q := ⟨f ≫ q, ...⟩ : F ⟶ embObj c`
  (built from a tabulation `(p, q)` of `S ⊒ R.R` in `𝒜`) satisfy:
    • `Entire P` ✓ (from `Map p` and `e ≤ 1_a ≤ pp°`)
    • `Simple P` ✓ (from `Simple p` and `e ≫ e = e`)
    • `P ≫ Q° = splRestrict E F S` ✓ (by definition)
  but the apex condition `P°P ∩ Q°Q = 1_c` FAILS:
    `P°P = q°·e·p` and the lower bound `1_c ≤ p°·e·p` requires `e ≥ 1_a`, which is
    false for proper symmetric idempotents.

  Freyd §2.165 uses the DOM-APEX `C = Dom(p°e) ∩ Dom(q°f)` on `c` (coreflexive), which
  the repo's infrastructure does not yet assemble into a ready-to-apply lemma.  The
  ingredients are available (`dom`, `coreflexive_symmetric_idempotent`, `spl_coreflexive_splits`)
  but combining them into the four tabulation checks requires ≈ 100 lines of
  modular-law bookkeeping not yet present as lemmas in the repo.

  WHY §2.16(10) forward is TODO:

  A tabulation of `embHom R` in `SplObj 𝒜` gives `P : embObj a ⟶ C`, `Q : embObj b ⟶ C`
  maps with `R = P.R ≫ Q.R°` and `P.R°P.R = C.idem.e = Q.R°Q.R`.  For `SemiSimple R` one
  needs simple `F₀ : c₀ → a` and `G₀ : c₀ → b` with `R = F₀° ≫ G₀`.  Setting `F₀ = P.R°`
  and `G₀ = Q.R°` gives `R = F₀° ≫ G₀` ✓, but `Simple F₀` requires `P.R ≫ P.R° ≤ 1_a`,
  while `Entire P` gives `1_a ≤ P.R ≫ P.R°`.  These are incompatible unless `P.R` is an
  isomorphism, so no direct conversion is possible without further work.

  WHY §2.16(10) backward is TODO:

  From semi-simplicity of `𝒜`, a morphism `R : E ⟶ F` in `SplObj 𝒜` has `R.R = F₀° ≫ G₀`
  with `F₀, G₀` simple.  The source-apex construction needs
  `SemiSimple R` in `SplObj 𝒜` (requiring `F₀` to absorb `E.idem.e` on the left, which is
  not guaranteed) and `[UnionAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)]` (pointwise union, not yet an instance).
  Both can be added with additional work.

  Conventions: diagram-order `R ≫ S`, reciprocation `R°`, `R ⊑ S`, `R ∩ S`.
  Mathlib-free.

/-! ## §2.165 / §2.166  Pre-tabular and tabular completion

  Both results are TODO pending Dom-apex infrastructure; see file header for the precise gap. -/

-- BOOK §2.165: If 𝒜 is pre-tabular then SplObj 𝒜 is pre-tabular.
-- TODO §2.165: Needs Dom-apex `C = Dom(p°e) ∩ Dom(q°f)` construction.  The legs
--   `P := ⟨e ≫ p, ...⟩` and `Q := ⟨f ≫ q, ...⟩` (from a tabulation `(p,q)` of S ⊒ R.R
--   in 𝒜`) satisfy Entire, Simple, and P≫Q° = splRestrict E F S, but the apex lower
--   bound `1_c ≤ P°P ∩ Q°Q` requires `e ≥ 1_a`, which fails for proper symmetric
--   idempotents.  Replace P, Q by Dom-apex-restricted legs once the infra exists.

-- BOOK §2.166: 𝒜 pre-tabular → SplObj 𝒜 tabular (§2.166: tabular ↔ pre-tabular + coref split).
-- TODO §2.166: Relies on §2.165.  The coreflexive-splitting half is available
--   (`spl_coreflexive_splits`) but the pre-tabular instance (§2.165) is blocked.

/-! ## §2.16(10)  `SplObj 𝒜` is tabular ↔ `𝒜` is semi-simple

  Both directions are TODO pending further infrastructure; see file header for the precise gaps.

  For the BACKWARD direction, the available route is:
    (a) Build `UnionAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)` (pointwise union).
    (b) Build `SemiSimple R` in `SplObj 𝒜` from semi-simplicity of `𝒜`.
    (c) Show `SplitsSymmIdem (SplObj 𝒜)` from `SplHom.split_symmetric_idempotent`.
    (d) Apply `srcTabulation_of_semiSimple_split` (S2_22.lean).
  Steps (a)–(b) require ≈ 50 additional lines of infrastructure. -/

-- BOOK §2.16(10) forward: SplObj 𝒜 tabular → 𝒜 semi-simple.
-- TODO §2.16(10)-fwd: A tabulation (P, Q) of embHom R in SplObj 𝒜 gives R = P.R ≫ Q.R°
--   with P.R°P.R = C.idem.e.  Setting F₀ = P.R° and G₀ = Q.R° gives R = F₀° ≫ G₀ ✓,
--   but Simple F₀ needs P.R ≫ P.R° ≤ 1_a, while Entire P gives 1_a ≤ P.R ≫ P.R°.
--   These only agree when P.R is an isomorphism; no direct conversion available.

-- BOOK §2.16(10) backward: 𝒜 semi-simple → SplObj 𝒜 tabular.
-- TODO §2.16(10)-bwd: Needs (a) UnionAllegory (SplObj 𝒜) (pointwise) and
--   (b) SemiSimple R for R : E ⟶ F in SplObj 𝒜 from hSS about 𝒜 (requires
--   the typed restriction F₀|_{E} = E.idem.e ≫ F₀° satisfying the SplHom fixed
--   condition, which needs F₀ to "absorb" E.idem.e on the left — not guaranteed).

/-! ## §2.42  `SplObj 𝒜` is an effective power allegory for a power allegory `𝒜`

  Freyd §2.42: if `𝒜` is a power allegory then `SplObj 𝒜` is an effective power allegory.

  Route: show `SplObj 𝒜` is `EffectivePrePowerAllegory` → apply
  `effective_pre_power_is_power` (S2_4) to get `PowerAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)`.

  PRIMARY BLOCKER: `EffectivePrePowerAllegory` extends `DistributiveAllegory`
  (→ `UnionAllegory` → union/zero).  The repo has these for `𝒜` but NOT for `SplObj 𝒜`.
  Adding `UnionAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)` is structurally straightforward (pointwise union)
  but not yet done.

  SECONDARY: given `UnionAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)`, `PrePowerAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)` needs
  ε-membership; `Thick ε` in `SplObj 𝒜` requires `straight_descent_thick` (S2_4). -/

-- TODO §2.42: add UnionAllegory/DistributiveAllegory instances for SplObj 𝒜, then prove
-- EffectivePrePowerAllegory (SplObj 𝒜) and invoke effective_pre_power_is_power.

/-! ## §2.433 / §2.434 / §2.435  Power allegory completions

  §2.433: If `𝒜` is a pre-power allegory, `Spl(Eq 𝒜)` is a power allegory.
          MISSING: `Spl(Eq 𝒜)` category construction.

  §2.434: The systemic completion of a small locally complete distributive allegory is a
          power allegory.  MISSING: systemic completion type.

  §2.435: A connected division allegory with a thick endomorphism is trivial.
          MISSING: `ConnectedAllegory` class.  The one-object §2.436 is in `S2_43.lean`. -/

-- §2.433: TODO — needs Spl(Eq 𝒜) construction.
-- §2.434: TODO — needs systemic completion (out of scope).
-- §2.435: TODO — needs ConnectedAllegory; see S2_43 for §2.436.
