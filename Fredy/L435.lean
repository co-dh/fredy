  LeetCode 435 — Non-overlapping Intervals — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given intervals `(lo, hi) : Int × Int`, each `lo < hi` (LeetCode 435's actual
  constraint is the STRICT `starti < endi`, not merely `lo ≤ hi` — this matters: with degenerate
  `lo = hi` point intervals the greedy-by-end-time exchange argument below has a genuine edge
  case, see the `Valid` docstring), return the MINIMUM number of intervals to remove so the rest
  are pairwise non-overlapping.  Touching endpoints are allowed (`[1,2]`/`[2,3]` do NOT overlap):
  overlap is the STRICT `a.lo < b.hi ∧ b.lo < a.hi`.

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L56.lean` (Merge Intervals) and the greedy-scan family (`Fredy/L55.lean`,
  `Fredy/L213.lean`, `Fredy/leetcode.md` S22/S19):

  1. **Data** — `List (Int × Int)`, `.1` = lo, `.2` = hi (no `SnocList` engine needed, as L56).

  2. **Program** — `solveFn ivs = ivs.length - (keptSorted (isortH ivs)).length`: `isortH` sorts
     by `.2` (end time, insertion sort ported from `L56`'s `isort`/`linsert`), then `keptSorted` is
     the standard greedy LEFT-TO-RIGHT scan over the end-sorted list: always take the first
     interval, then keep the next one iff its `.1 ≥` the running kept interval's `.2`.
     `keptSorted`/`keptList` return the ACTUAL kept sublist (not just a count), so achievability
     is a genuine witness, not merely a numeral.

  3. **Specification** — the honest one: `keptSorted (isortH ivs)`'s LENGTH is the MAXIMUM size of
     a pairwise non-overlapping sub-selection of `ivs`; "min removals" is `length − max`.  A
     "sub-selection" is `List.Sublist` (`<+`, Lean core, an order-preserving sub-list — the right
     multiplicity-respecting notion of "a subset of the given intervals", unlike `⊆` which would
     ignore duplicate copies); "pairwise non-overlapping" is `List.Pairwise NoOverlap` (Lean core).
     Correctness (`solve_correct`) is BOTH halves:
       - **achievability**: some `sub <+ ivs` is `NonOverlap` and has length `ivs.length -
         solveFn ivs`;
       - **optimality/domination**: EVERY `sub <+ ivs` that is `NonOverlap` has length `≤
         ivs.length − solveFn ivs` — i.e. no smaller number of removals ever works.

  4. **The real content — the exchange argument.**  The greedy scan is defined and analysed on
     the SORTED list `isortH ivs`, where "keep the sorted list's own head" is manifestly the
     locally-min-`.2` choice (`keptList_dom`, an induction generalizing an external threshold
     `lastEnd`, mirroring `L56`'s `mergeRun_inv`).  The one genuinely delicate fact
     (`keptList_length_mono`/`keptList_length_step`, proved by a SINGLE combined induction because
     each needs the other in one case) is that raising the greedy's starting threshold from `t` to
     a larger `t'` can (a) never INCREASE the kept count (`_mono`, needs `SortedH`+`Valid` only)
     and (b) never DECREASE it by more than ONE, provided every remaining interval's `.2 ≥ t'`
     (`_step` — exactly the situation right after skipping one incompatible head).  Since an
     arbitrary competing `sub` need not be phrased on the SORTED list at all, the bridge back to
     the ORIGINAL `ivs` is Lean core's `List.exists_perm_sublist` (`l₁ <+ l₂ → l₂ ~ l₂' → ∃ l₁', l₁'
     ~ l₁ ∧ l₁' <+ l₂'`) applied to the permutation `ivs ~ isortH ivs` (`ivs_perm_isortH`, a direct
     port of the classical "insertion sort is a permutation" induction) — this reduces "an
     arbitrary sub-selection of the UNSORTED `ivs`" to "a same-length, same-`NonOverlap`-ness
     sub-selection of the SORTED list" for free, with NO hand-rolled sublist-of-a-sort lemma
     needed.  `List.Pairwise`'s own `Perm.pairwise_iff`/`Pairwise.perm` (for the symmetric relation
     `NoOverlap`) transports `NonOverlap` across that same permutation.

  Mathlib-free (only Lean core `Init` — `List.Sublist`, `List.Perm`, `List.Pairwise` — plus
  `Fredy.A6_1_RelSet`).  No `Classical.choice`; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}.

    `lo = hi` point interval `m`, `m` could tie for minimum `.2` with a longer interval `j` ending
    at the very same point while `j.lo < m.lo`, and `NoOverlap m j` holds vacuously (touching only
    at that shared point) WITHOUT giving `m.2 ≤ j.1` — the fact the greedy's threshold-passing

/-- **Correctness (headline)**: `solveFn ivs` is the minimum number of intervals to remove so the
    rest are pairwise non-overlapping.  Two halves, exactly LeetCode 435's own meaning:
    - achievability — removing `solveFn ivs` intervals IS achievable (some `sub <+ ivs` of size
      `ivs.length - solveFn ivs` is `NonOverlap`);
    - optimality — no smaller number of removals ever works (every `NonOverlap sub <+ ivs` has
      length `≤ ivs.length - solveFn ivs`, i.e. you can never KEEP more than that many). -/
