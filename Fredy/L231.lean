  LeetCode 231 — Power of Two — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given an integer `n`, decide whether it is a power of two, i.e. whether `n = 2^k` for
  some `k : Nat`.  `n` must be positive (`0` and negatives are never powers of two).

  Same DECISION-problem recipe as `Fredy/L9.lean`/`Fredy/L217.lean` (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S5):
  correctness is a plain `iff`, not a refinement+domination extremum.  Like `L9`, the input is a
  bare `Int`, not a `SnocList` — no list-datatype engine is needed here at all.

  1. **Data** — the input object is `Int` directly; the answer object is `Bool`.

  2. **Program (fuel).** `pow2Fuel fuel m` repeatedly halves `m` while it is even, recursing on
     FUEL (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S13) rather than on `m` itself, since `m / 2` decreases a second,
     independently-shrinking argument and so does not compile to plain structural recursion:
     `m = 1` accepts; `m = 0` or `m` odd `> 1` rejects; otherwise recurse on `m / 2` with one less
     fuel.  `isPow2Fn n := if n ≤ 0 then false else pow2Fuel n.toNat n.toNat` — fuel `n.toNat` is
     always enough, since halving a positive `m` reaches `1` in at most `m` steps.

  3/4. **Specification and correctness.** `pow2_correct` is the honest unfolding: `n` is a power
     of two iff `0 < n` and `n = 2^k` for some `k : Nat` — exactly LeetCode's definition, no
     `Decidable`-instance detour.  Two halves, both by induction on the fuel: `pow2Fuel_pow`
     (halving `2^k` reaches `1` within `k` steps of fuel — the forward witness) and
     `pow2Fuel_to_exists` (accepting fuel-`m` pairs are exactly the powers of two — the converse,
     recovering the exponent from the halving trace).  The `Int`/`Nat` boundary is crossed once via
     `Int.toNat_of_nonneg` and `Int.natCast_pow`.

  Mathlib-free; axioms `[propext, Quot.sound]` (fully constructive — no `Classical.choice`).

/-! ## The program: fuel-guarded halving decision -/

/-- `pow2Fuel fuel m` — does repeatedly halving `m` (while even) reach `1`?  Recursion is on
    `fuel`, not on `m`: `m / 2` decreases a second, independently-shrinking argument, so a direct
    recursion on `m` would compile to well-founded (non-`rfl`-reducible) recursion. -/

  | fuel + 1, m =>
    if m = 1 then true
    else if m = 0 then false
    else if m % 2 = 0 then pow2Fuel fuel (m / 2) else false

/-- `isPow2Fn n` — is `n` a power of two?  Guard the sign once, at the `Int` boundary; the halving
    itself stays on `Nat`.  Fuel `n.toNat` is always enough: halving a positive `m` strictly
    decreases and reaches `1` in at most `m` steps. -/
