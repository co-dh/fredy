  LeetCode 543 — Diameter of Binary Tree — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM (tupled tree cata).

  Problem: the diameter is the number of EDGES on the longest path between any two nodes in the
  tree (the path need not pass through the root; a single-node tree has diameter `0`).

  `L124`'s `(best, gain)` shape, one level simpler (`Nat` throughout, no `Option`, no dependence on
  node VALUES — edge counts are never negative, and the empty tree's diameter, `0`, is a genuine
  achievable value, not a "no path" case needing a sentinel):

  1. **Program.**  `foldFn t = (height, diam)`: `height` is `L104`'s `depthFn` (node-counted depth,
     `nil ↦ 0`, `node ↦ 1 + max(hl, hr)`) — folded again here so the SAME pass also threads `diam`.
     `diam` is the max number of edges on ANY path in `t`: the best of the left subtree, the right
     subtree, or the path that bends AT this root, connecting the deepest point reachable in each
     child — `through = hl + hr` (each child's `height` already counts the edge INTO that child's
     own deepest descendant, so `hl + hr`, not `hl + hr + 2`, is the through-root edge total).

  2. **Specification, two layers (through-root vs in-subtree), the `L124`/`L104` shape.**
     `downPath t v` — `v` is the length of SOME root-to-`nil` path in `t` (verbatim `L104`'s
     `pathLen`, re-derived here since `L104` isn't imported: `nil ↦ v = 0`, so a `nil` child is a
     legitimate, non-`False`, zero-length path — this is what sidesteps `L124`'s nil-child witness
     trap here).  `pathEdges t k` — `k` is the edge-count of SOME valid path in `t`: entirely in the
     left subtree, entirely in the right, or bending at the root (`downPath l kl`, `downPath r kr`,
     `k = kl + kr`).  LeetCode 543 asks for `pathEdges`'s `≤`-maximum, `max (≤) · Λ pathEdges`, for
     EVERY tree (`nil` included: `pathEdges nil k := k = 0`, matching the fold's `diam = 0` there —
     no `L124`-style `Option`/non-empty carve-out needed).

  3. **Correctness.**  `height_achieves`/`height_dominates`: `heightFn = max (≤) · Λ downPath` (the
     `L104` result, re-derived here).  `solve_achieves`/`solve_dominates`: `solveFn = max (≤) · Λ
     pathEdges`, by ONE structural recursion on `t` (including `nil`), using
     `height_achieves`/`height_dominates` to bound the through-root layer and `imax_eq_or` for the
     three-way choice in `diam`.
