  In a pre-topos, given monics x: A↣B, y: A↣C, there exists a
  pushout B ↣ D, C ↣ D completing the square. -/

/-- **§1.651 Amalgamation Lemma**: In a pre-topos, the pushout of two
    monics with a common source exists and the resulting maps are monic.
    Proof: form B+C, define equivalence relation E identifying x(a)∼y(a),
    then the effective quotient B+C ↠ D gives the pushout.
    Requires effective regularity (every equivalence relation has a coequalizer)
    which needs additional structure in `EffectiveRegular`. -/

/-! ## §1.652 Covers = epics, Monics = cocovers

  In a pre-topos, covers coincide with epimorphisms, and monics
  coincide with coequalizers (cocovers). -/

/-- **§1.652 (crux): a pre-topos is BALANCED** — a map that is both monic and
    epic is an isomorphism.  This is the genuine positivity content of §1.652:
    the cokernel pair of `m` is built from the *disjoint* coproduct `B + B`
    (positivity) via the effective quotient, and a monic that is also epic
    equalizes a pair of equal legs, hence splits.  It is **not** derivable from
    the current axioms — `HasBinaryCoproducts` carries only the bare universal
    property, with no disjointness/universality, so the cokernel-pair argument
    has no axiom to stand on.  Isolated here as the single obligation that both
    reverse-directions below (`cover_eq_epic_preTopos`, `monic_eq_cocover`) rest
    on; closing it needs §1.62 positivity axiomatized as Freyd states it
    (disjoint + universal coproducts). -/

/-! ## §1.654/§1.657 Pre-topos is cocartesian iff minimal equivalence relations exist

  A pre-topos is COCARTESIAN (its opposite is regular) if and only if
  for every endo-relation R on an object A there exists a minimal
  equivalence relation Ê ⊇ R on A.
  (§1.657: effectiveness means Ê is the level of some coequalizer A → B.)

  Proof sketch (§1.657):
  · (⇒) If A has coequalizers, given f: A→B with level E ⊇ R, then E is
    the minimal equivalence relation containing R (effectiveness).
  · (⇐) Conversely, given R = x°y (level of x,y : C⇒A), form the
    minimal equivalence Ê containing x°y; by effectiveness, Ê = level of
    some cover z: A→B; then z is a coequalizer of x and y. -/

/-- **§1.657**: A pre-topos with coequalizers satisfies HasMinEquivContaining.
    Effectiveness supplies the minimal equivalence relation as the level of
    the coequalizer, and conversely the minimal equivalence relation yields
    the coequalizer by effectiveness.

/-! ## §1.658 Decidable object

  An object A in a pre-logos is DECIDABLE if the diagonal (1,1): A → A×A
  has a complement in the subobject lattice of A×A.

  Every object in a pre-topos is decidable iff the pre-topos is boolean.

  PROOF SKETCH:
  (⇐) Boolean ⇒ every subobject is complemented, in particular the diagonal.
  (⇒) Given A decidable, let A' → A×B be any subobject; form the equalizer of
      (A' → A×B → B → B×B) and (A' → A×B → A×B → B×B via diag∘second).
      Because pullbacks of complemented subobjects are complemented (§1.658),
      the Boolean algebra structure transfers to all subobjects via slices. -/

/-- **§1.658**: A in a pre-logos is DECIDABLE if the diagonal `diag A : A → A×A`
    has a complement in `Subobject 𝒞 (prod A A)`.
    Lean note: `diag A` is monic (§1.42: `diag_mono`); the subobject is `{ dom := A, arr := diag A, monic := diag_mono A }`. -/
def DecidableObject [PreLogos 𝒞] [HasBinaryProducts 𝒞] (A : 𝒞) : Prop :=

/-- **§1.658**: Every object in a pre-topos is decidable iff the pre-topos is boolean.
    The harder direction (all decidable → boolean) follows because pullbacks of
    complemented subobjects are complemented, and every subobject U ⊆ 1 can be
    pulled back to any slice, where it coincides with the diagonal. -/

/-! ## §1.66 Choice objects in a pre-topos

  We study choice objects [§1.57] in a regular category. -/

section Choice66

variable [RegularCategory 𝒞]

/-- **§1.66**: A subobject of a choice object is choice.
    If C is choice and m: A↣C is monic, then A is choice.
    PROOF: Let R be an entire relation from X to A.
    Then m ≫ R is an entire relation from X to C (composition with a map).
    Because C is choice, m ≫ R contains a map f: X → C.
    Since m is monic, f factors uniquely through A: the factorization gives
    the required map in R. (Requires: entire relations compose with maps.) -/

/-- **§1.66**: A quotient (cover target) of a choice object is choice.
    If C is choice and x: C↠B is a cover, then B is choice.

    (the inclusion via a map contained in x°). Apply subobject_of_choice. -/

/-! ## §1.661 Finite products of choice objects are choice

  In a regular category, finite products of choice objects are choice.
  (Proof uses: any entire relation targeted at a terminator is already a map;
  for binary products, decompose R : X → B₁×B₂ via its projections.) -/

section Choice661

variable [RegularCategory 𝒞]

/-- **§1.661**: The terminator (terminal object) is always choice in a regular category.
    PROOF: Any entire relation R : X → 1 is simple (the unique map term X : X → 1
    factors through R), so R contains the map term X. -/
theorem terminator_is_choice : Choice (one : 𝒞) := by

/-- **§1.661**: The binary product of two choice objects is choice.
    PROOF (book §1.661): Let R be entire from A to B₁×B₂.
    R∘fst° is entire targeted at B₁, so it contains a map f₁.
    In Sets, R ∩ f₁∘fst° is entire (§1.551, §1.563 transfer to any regular category).
    Its projection R ∩ f₁∘fst°∘snd° is entire targeted at B₂, so it contains f₂.
    Then (f₁, f₂): A → B₁×B₂ is contained in R. -/

/-! ## §1.662 Diaconescu's theorem in a pre-topos

  In a pre-topos, the following are equivalent:
  (1) Binary coproducts of choice objects are choice.
  (2) 1+1 is choice.
  (3) The pre-topos is boolean. -/

section Diaconescu

  h one one terminator_is_choice terminator_is_choice

/-- **§1.662**: (2) → (3): 1+1 choice implies boolean.
    PROOF: The intermediate condition (2a) — every cover X∪Y=B can be
    refined to a partition X'⊆X, Y'⊆Y with X'∪Y'=B and X'∩Y'=∅ —
    is a restatement of (2) because maps B → 1+1 are partitions of B.
    (2a) is inherited by slices, so it suffices to show 𝒮(1) is boolean.
    Any U ⊆ 1 gives a pushout P = 1 +_U 1; 1+1 choice ⟹ P is a subobject
    of 1+1; 1+1 is decidable (§1.658) and so is P; U is complemented as a
    pullback of a complemented subobject. -/

/-- **§1.662**: (3) → (1): boolean implies binary coproducts of choice objects are choice.
    PROOF: Given S: A → B₁+B₂ entire, the subobject Dom(S∘inl°) ⊆ A is complemented
    (boolean pre-topos). The restriction of S to Dom(S∘inl°) is entire into B₁, so
    contains f₁ (B₁ choice). The restriction to the complement is entire into B₂,
    so contains f₂ (B₂ choice). Then f₁+f₂ (copairing) is a map in S. -/
