/-! ## §1.63 Slice of a (positive) pre-logos is a (positive) pre-logos

  Freyd §1.63: for any pre-logos A and object B, the slice A/B is again a
  pre-logos, and Σ : A/B → A is an iso on subobject lattices.  The two
  italic propositions at §1.63 are:

  (1) "If A is a (positive) pre-logos then so is A/B."
  (2) "Any (positive) pre-logos is faithfully representable in a capital
      (positive) pre-logos."

  Both require slice/over-category infrastructure (`Over`) + a `PreLogos`
  instance on `Over A B`.  That infrastructure lives in `SliceRegular.lean`
  (`PreRegularCategory (Over B)`).  The full `PreLogos (Over B)` instance
  would also need `HasSubobjectUnions (Over B)`, which is not yet supplied.
  Propositions recorded as TODO until the `PreLogos (Over B)` instance lands. -/

-- BOOK §1.63: If A is a (positive) pre-logos then so is A/B.
-- TODO: needs `PreLogos (Over B)` instance (slice inherits unions via Σ iso).

-- BOOK §1.63: Any (positive) pre-logos is faithfully representable in a capital
-- (positive) pre-logos.
-- TODO: uses §1.543 capitalization lemma (proven) + slice construction above;
-- blocked on `PreLogos (Over B)` instance.

/-! ## §1.631 Complemented subobject

  A₁ ⊆ A is COMPLEMENTED if ∃ A₂ ⊆ A with A₁∩A₂=0, A₁∪A₂=A. -/

-- NOTE: `[PreLogos 𝒞]` is attached locally to each declaration that needs it rather
-- than as a module-level `variable`.  A module-level `[PreLogos 𝒞]` would form a
-- diamond with `DisjointBinaryCoproduct.toPreLogos` (§1.621 block below), since that
-- class also supplies a `PreLogos` instance for the same `𝒞`.

/-- A₁ is COMPLEMENTED (§1.631): ∃ A₂ with A₁∩A₂ = 0 and A₁∪A₂ = A.
    The disjointness "A₁∩A₂ = 0" is phrased as the *meet-is-bottom* universal property
    `∀ S, S≤A₁ → S≤A₂ → S≤⊥` — equivalent to `inter A₁ A₂ ≤ bottom` (`IsComplementedSub`,
    §1.62; bridge lemma `isComplemented_iff_sub` below), but mentioning NO `HasPullbacks`
    instance, so it avoids the `PreLogos`/`PreTopos` diamond.
    NB: the earlier form wrote `→ False` instead of `→ S≤⊥`; that is UNSATISFIABLE (take
    `S := bottom`, which is `≤` everything), so it held for no subobject and made
    `BooleanPreLogos` uninhabitable — a stale placeholder, now corrected. -/
def IsComplemented [PreLogos 𝒞] {A : 𝒞} (A₁ : Subobject 𝒞 A) : Prop :=
  ∃ (A₂ : Subobject 𝒞 A),
    (∀ (S : Subobject 𝒞 A), Subobject.le S A₁ → Subobject.le S A₂ → Subobject.le S (PreLogos.bottom A))
    -- A₁∩A₂ ≤ 0 (meet is bottom — instance-free phrasing of `inter A₁ A₂ ≤ bottom`)
    ∧ Subobject.le (Subobject.entire A) (HasSubobjectUnions.union A₁ A₂)
    -- A₁∪A₂ = A (entire)

/-- **Bridge** (§1.631 ⇔ §1.62): the meet-universal form `IsComplemented` (this file) and the
    inter-based form `IsComplementedSub` (`S1_62`, consumed by `Complement.lean`) agree.
    Same witness `A₂`; the union clauses are literally identical, and the two disjointness
    clauses are equivalent because `Subobject.inter A₁ A₂` is the meet (greatest common lower
    bound): `inter A₁ A₂ ≤ ⊥` iff every common lower bound `S` of `A₁`, `A₂` is `≤ ⊥`. -/

  is Boolean (every subobject has a complement). -/

/-! ## §1.645 𝒦𝓮𝓇(T) — values killed by a representation

  For T: A → B a representation of boolean pre-logoi, Kℯℛ(T) is
  the set of subterminators U ⊆ 1 such that T(U) = 0. -/

/-- **§1.645** `Kℯℛ(T) = { U ⊆ 1 | T(U) = 0 }` — the set of subterminators whose
    value under the representation `T` is the NULL (zero) object.

    Book text (§1.645): "we define `𝒦ℯℛ(T)` as the set of values killed by `T`:
    `𝒦ℯℛ(T) = { U ⊆ 1 | T(U) = 0 }`".  Here `0` is the bottom of the target's
    subobject lattice (`PreLogos.bottom`, the empty join / null object) — the
    OPPOSITE extreme from the terminator `1`.

    INTEGRITY FIX: the previous definition tested `Isomorphic (T U.dom) one`
    (the terminator, i.e. `T(U) = 1`), which is exactly backwards — it would make
    `Kℯℛ(T)` the values sent to the TOP rather than killed.  Corrected to test
    against the zero object `(PreLogos.bottom _).dom`. -/

/-! ## §1.637 Special pre-logos and characterization

  A pre-logos is SPECIAL if it satisfies every universal sentence in the
  predicates of pre-logoi satisfied by the category of sets.
  The book gives an elementary internal characterization at §1.637 and
  studies S^A and LH(Y) at §1.638. -/

/-- A pre-logos is SPECIAL if for every pair of proper subobjects A'⊂A, B'⊂B,
    the subobject (A'×B)∪(A×B') is proper in A×B.
    §1.637: this is the elementary internal characterization of special pre-logoi. -/
-- BOOK §1.637: A pre-logos is special iff for every pair of proper subobjects
--   A'⊂A, B'⊂B, (A'×B)∪(A×B') is a proper subobject of A×B.
-- TODO: needs binary-product interaction with `HasSubobjectUnions`; the
-- properness direction uses `finite_separation` (FiniteSeparation.lean).

-- BOOK §1.642: For A a small category, S^A is a boolean pre-logos iff A is a groupoid.
-- TODO: needs Set-valued functor category (S^A) infrastructure not in this repo.

/-! ## §1.646 Faithful representability of small special categories

  Every small special Cartesian category is faithfully representable in Set.
  Every small special positive pre-logos is faithfully representable in Set.
  PROOF (§1.646): Combine §1.472/§1.637 (finite separation) with a diagonal
  ultra-filter argument: I = finite sets of proper subobjects, choose T_S for
  each S, form T : A → Set^I, extend to an ultra-filter F ⊇ principal coideals.
  T^F is faithful.  (Requires ultra-filter machinery; Sorry.) -/

-- §1.646 (note): Every small special Cartesian category embeds faithfully in Set.
-- Proof combines §1.472/§1.637 with an ultra-filter diagonal argument.
-- Requires ultra-filter infrastructure outside this repo's scope.

-- §1.646 (note): Every small special positive pre-logos embeds faithfully in Set.
-- Same proof as above, additionally using that T_F̂ preserves disjoint unions
-- (§1.634, for an ultra-filter F̂).  Requires ultra-filter infrastructure.

-- §1.647 (note): A boolean pre-logos is special iff two-valued.
-- Proof: complement of (A₁×B)∪(A×B₂) in A×B is A₁'×B₂' (§1.647 formula);
-- two-valued iff every subobject lattice is {0,1} (degenerate or two-element boolean alg).
-- TODO: needs `complement_product_union` lemma (complement arithmetic in BooleanPreLogos).

-- §1.648 (note): Ultra-power T = Set^I → Set^I/F is bicartesian iff F is
-- a complete measure (meets every countable partition of I).
-- Requires ultra-filter/ultra-product infrastructure outside this repo.

  `coprod_inl_inr_disjoint_elt`) now live in `Fredy.S1_62`, next to their natural
  home `PositivePreLogos` (§1.623), so the §1.624/§1.631 corollaries there can
  consume them without a cyclic import back into this file.  They remain in scope
  here via `import Fredy.S1_62`.  Only `PreToposDisjoint` stays below, because it

/-! ## §1.654/§1.657 Pre-topos is cocartesian iff minimal equivalence relations exist

  A pre-topos is COCARTESIAN (its opposite is regular) if and only if
  for every endo-relation R on an object A there exists a minimal
  equivalence relation Ê ⊇ R on A.
  (§1.657: effectiveness means Ê is the level of some coequalizer A → B.)

  Proof sketch (§1.657):
  · (⇒) If A has coequalizers, given f: A→B with level E ⊇ R, then E is
    the minimal equivalence relation containing R (effectiveness).
  · (⇐) Conversely, given R = x°y (level of x,y : C⇒A), form the
    minimal equivalence Ê containing x°y; by effectiveness, Ê = level of
    some cover z: A→B; then z is a coequalizer of x and y. -/

/-- **§1.775/§1.657 (the `HasReflTransClosure` payoff)**: a category with all reflexive-transitive
    closures has all minimal equivalence relations.

    Given `R` on `A`, form the symmetrisation `Rsym := (R ∪ᵣ R°) ∪ᵣ graph(id A)` (the join of `R`,
    its reciprocal, and the diagonal), then take `E := rtc Rsym`.  By §1.775
    (`equivClos_from_symm_transRefClos`), `E` is the *equivalence closure* of `R`: the minimum
    equivalence relation containing `R`.  Converting the §1.775 `IsEquivRel` form to the §1.567
    `EquivalenceRelation` form yields exactly `HasMinEquivContaining`.

    This is the constructive replacement for `preTopos_cocartesian_to_minEquiv` (which built the
    minimal equivalence from coequalizers + effectiveness): here it is built from R* directly. -/

/-! ### Relation-algebra infrastructure for amalgamation leg-monicity (§1.651)

  The leg-monicity `Monic (inl ≫ q)` reduces to a relation containment
  `graph inl ⊚ E ⊚ (graph inl)° ⊂ 1_B`.  Distributing `E ⊂ F = 1 ∪ R₀ ∪ R₀°`
  (minimality of `E`), the cross terms `R₀, R₀°` vanish because `R₀` only relates
  `inl(B)` to `inr(C)`: composing them against `graph inl` hits the disjoint
  intersection `inl ∩ inr = 0` (§1.62 positivity), so the composite relation's
  tabulation sits below the bottom subobject — hence below *every* relation, in
  particular the diagonal.  The diagonal term `graph inl ⊚ 1 ⊚ (graph inl)° =
  graph inl ⊚ (graph inl)°` is `⊂ 1_B` since `inl` is monic. -/

/-! ## §1.651 Amalgamation Lemma

  In a pre-topos, given monics x: A↣B, y: A↣C, there exists a
  pushout B ↣ D, C ↣ D completing the square. -/

/-- **§1.651 Amalgamation Lemma**: In a pre-topos, the pushout of two
    monics with a common source exists and the resulting maps are monic.
    Proof: form B+C, define equivalence relation E identifying x(a)∼y(a),
    then the effective quotient B+C ↠ D gives the pushout.

    CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRESS (this file): with `[DisjointBinaryCoproduct 𝒞]` supplying §1.62
    positivity and `[HasReflTransClosure 𝒞]` supplying the reflexive-transitive closure R*
    (§1.77/§1.947), the pushout is now built EXACTLY as Freyd describes (§1.651): on `B+C` take the
    relation `R₀` generated by `{x(a)≫inl ∼ y(a)≫inr}` (the image relation of
    `pair(x≫inl, y≫inr)`), close it to the *minimal equivalence relation* `E ⊇ R₀` — now a
    genuine constructive object via `minEquiv_of_rtc` (the §1.775 equivalence closure
    `(R₀ ∪ R₀°)*`) — and let `q : B+C ↠ D` be the effective quotient by `E` (effectiveness,
    §1.568/§1.65).  Then `u := inl≫q`, `v := inr≫q`.  The commutativity leg `x≫u = y≫v` is
    discharged Sorry-free: `R₀ ⊑ E ⊑ level q`, and `R₀`'s two columns are exactly `x≫inl`,
    `y≫inr`, so they agree after `q`.

    SHARPENED RESIDUAL (the `Sorry`s below): leg-monicity `Monic u`, `Monic v` — that the level of
    `q` (= `E`, the generated equivalence relation) restricts to the *diagonal* on `inl(B)` (resp.
    `inr(C)`).  Disjointness (`inl_inter_inr_le_bottom`, `coprod_inl_inr_disjoint_elt`) and
    `inl/inr_mono` are necessary, but the proof additionally needs a zigzag/path-length induction
    over the transitive-closure structure of `E`, which the `rtc` abstraction does NOT expose (it
    gives the four closure properties, not an induction principle on `relPow` path length).  That
    path-length descent is the effective-quotient analysis of this section (independent of the
    §1.543 capitalization lemma, which is proven).  Faithful Sorry on
    precisely the two leg monicities; the object `D`, the maps `u, v`, and the commuting square are
    now real and routed through Freyd's generated-equivalence-relation construction. -/

/-- **§1.651 (pullback half)**: the amalgamating square of two monics is a PULLBACK.

    For monics `m : A↣B`, `n : A↣C`, run the §1.651 amalgamation construction on `B+C`:
    `R₀ :=` image of `pair(m≫inl, n≫inr)`, minimal equivalence `E ⊇ R₀`, effective quotient
    `q : B+C ↠ D`, legs `u := inl≫q`, `v := inr≫q`.  The square `m≫u = n≫v` (the
    commutativity leg) is a pullback: `A` with `(m, n)` IS `B ×_D C`.

    The factorization is the CROSS read-off, dual to `amalgamation_lemma`'s diagonal
    leg-monicity.  A cone point `(b, c)` with `b≫u = c≫v` means `b≫inl ∼_E c≫inr`, i.e.
    `(b≫inl, c≫inr)` lies in `kernelPairRel q`.  Pre/post-composing with `inl`, `inr°`
    keeps the point in the inl×inr CROSS, where (by `E ⊆ F = 1 ∪ R₀ ∪ R₀°` minimality and
    §1.62 disjointness vanishing the `1`/`R₀°` summands) the relation collapses to
    `R₀ ≤ (m≫inl)° ⊚ (n≫inr)`, and the two monic injections cancel to `m° ⊚ n`.  So the
    point factors through `relSub(m° ⊚ n) = image(pair m n)`, giving `a : pt → A` with
    `a≫m = b`, `a≫n = c`; uniqueness from `m` monic. -/

/-- **§1.651 (pushout property)**: the amalgamating square of two maps is a PUSHOUT.

    Companion to `amalgamation_is_pullback` (which needs `m, n` monic); the pushout
    universal property holds for ARBITRARY `m, n`.  The effective quotient `q : B+C ↠ D` by
    the minimal equivalence `E ⊇ R₀` is universal: any cocone `(Q; uQ, vQ)` over `(m, n)`
    yields `case uQ vQ : B+C → Q` respecting `R₀` (so `E ⊆ level(case uQ vQ)` by minimality),
    hence factoring uniquely through the cover `q` (`cover_is_coequalizer_of_level`).  This is
    what identifies the §1.651 `D` with the §1.62 union `A₁∪A₂` (both pushouts of the same
    span), the missing converse flagged on `preTopos_functor_preserves_monic_pullbacks`. -/

/-! ### §1.652 cokernel-pair infrastructure (effective-coregularity scaffolding)

  The cokernel pair of `m : A → B` is the pushout of `(m, m)`, equivalently the
  COEQUALIZER of the two injections `m ≫ inl, m ≫ inr : A ⇉ B ⊕ B`.  A pre-topos has
  binary coproducts (via `PositivePreLogos`) and — with `[HasReflTransClosure 𝒞]` —
  coequalizers (`preTopos_minEquiv_to_cocartesian (minEquiv_of_rtc)`), so this object is
  a genuine, Sorry-free construction.  It is the dual of the kernel pair used throughout
  §1.566/§1.567, and is the carrier of the §1.652 balancedness / monic-is-cocover content.

  Built here as standalone data so all three §1.652/§1.653 obligations share one
  construction (DRY).  The coequalizer map `c : B ⊕ B ↠ P` is a cover (`coeq_map_is_cover`),
  hence (§1.566) the coequalizer of its own kernel pair; the two legs `u := inl ≫ c`,
  `v := inr ≫ c` satisfy `m ≫ u = m ≫ v`, and `m` factors through the equalizer of `(u, v)`. -/

/-- **§1.652 (the reverse F-analysis)**: in a pre-topos, a MONIC that is also EPIC is a COVER.

    This is the dual read-off of `amalgamation_lemma`'s leg-monicity, on the SAME generated
    equivalence relation `E ⊆ F = 1 ∪ R₀ ∪ R₀°` over the disjoint coproduct `B ⊕ B`.  Apply the
    §1.651 amalgamation construction to `x = y = m`: on `B ⊕ B` take `R₀ =` image of
    `pair(m≫inl, m≫inr)`, close it to the minimal equivalence `E` (via `minEquiv_of_rtc`), and let
    `q : B ⊕ B ↠ D` be its effective quotient, with legs `u := inl≫q`, `v := inr≫q`.

    `m` epic forces `u = v` (`hepi` applied to the cokernel-pair square `m≫u = m≫v`).  Then:
    * (totality, lower bound) `1_B ≤ u ⊚ u° = (inl≫q) ⊚ (inr≫q)°` (using `u = v`)
      `≤ inl ⊚ (q ⊚ q°) ⊚ inr° ≤ inl ⊚ E ⊚ inr°` (since `q⊚q° ≤ E`);
    * (`E ⊆ F` + cross-vanishing) `inl ⊚ E ⊚ inr° ≤ inl ⊚ F ⊚ inr° ≤ inl ⊚ R₀ ⊚ inr°`, because the
      `1` and `R₀°` summands of `F` vanish on the inl/inr cross by §1.62 disjointness
      (`inl ∩ inr = 0`);
    * (collapse) `inl ⊚ R₀ ⊚ inr° ≤ inl ⊚ (m≫inl)° ⊚ (m≫inr) ⊚ inr° = (inl⊚inl°) ⊚ m° ⊚ m ⊚ (inr⊚inr°)
      = m° ⊚ m` (both `inl`, `inr` monic, so their levels are the diagonal).
    Chaining: `1_B ≤ m° ⊚ m`, which is exactly the relational cover criterion §1.569
    (`cover_iff_one_le_reciprocal_comp_self`).  No path-length / `relPow` induction is needed: the
    cross-vanishing is the same `relSub_*_le_bottom` positivity used for leg-monicity. -/

/-- **§1.652**: In a pre-topos, monics coincide with cocovers.

    A *cocover* is the dual of a cover: a regular mono = the equalizer of some parallel pair.
    Freyd's argument (§1.652) is: given a monic `x : A ↣ B`, form its cokernel pair `y, z : B ⇉ C`
    (so `x ≫ y = x ≫ z`); then "`x` is an equalizer of `y, z`, hence a cocover."  The amalgamation
    lemma §1.651 makes the cokernel-pair square `(A; x, x)` a *pullback*, and a pullback of `(y, z)`
    whose two legs coincide is exactly an equalizer of `(y, z)`.

    STATEMENT REDRAFT (the previous `HEq` encoding was a defect):
    the old form `∃ C p q, HEq ((coeq p q).map) f` is unprovable.  `HEq` between
    `(coeq p q).map : C ⟶ (coeq p q).obj` and `f : A ⟶ B` forces the *objects* `(coeq p q).obj` and
    `B` to be heterogeneously equal — but a (co)limit object is only ever *isomorphic* to `B`, never
    definitionally equal.  So forward would need an arbitrary mono's witness object to be defeq to
    `B`, and reverse would make a cover (coequalizer-map) monic.  The faithful statement, matching
    "`x` is an equalizer of `y, z`", is: `f` is monic iff `f` is the equalizer of some parallel pair
    `p, q : B ⇉ C` out of its codomain (predicate `EqualizerCone.IsEqualizer`, choice-free, with no
    object collapse).  This is precisely the book's "monics coincide with cocovers (= regular
    monos)".  The extra `[PreToposDisjoint]`/`[HasReflTransClosure]` instances are the same ambient
    pre-topos data §1.651 uses for the amalgamation pullback. -/

/-- **§1.653 (cover transport)**: given a cover `e : A ↠ I` and a monic `y : A ↣ C`,
    push `y` along `e` to a monic `y' : I ↣ C'` over a fresh codomain `C'`, with a
    comparison cover `c' : C ↠ C'` making the square commute (`e ≫ y' = y ≫ c'`).
    Freyd's construction (§1.653): on `C` form `R₀ := y° (level e) y` (the image, under
    `y`, of the kernel-pair relation of `e`), generate the equivalence relation
    `E' := Δ_C ∪ R₀`, and let `c' : C ↠ C'` be its effective quotient.  Then `level e =
    level (y ≫ c')`, so `y ≫ c'` coequalizes the kernel pair of `e` (gives `y'`), and
    `y'` is monic because `level (y ≫ c') ⊂ Δ_I`. -/

  Given morphisms f: A → B and monic y: A ↣ C in a pre-topos, there is a pushout
  square with the top map monic.  The proof factors f as cover ∘ monic (image
  factorization) and applies the amalgamation lemma §1.651 to the two monics. -/

/-- **§1.653**: In a pre-topos, given f : A → B and monic y : A ↣ C, there exists a

    PROOF: Factor A → B as A ↠ I ↣ B (image factorization, `e := image.lift f`, `i :=
    (image f).arr`).  Transport `y` along the cover `e` to a monic `y' : I ↣ C'` with a
    comparison cover `c' : C ↠ C'` (`cover_transport_mono`), giving `e ≫ y' = y ≫ c'`.
    Apply the amalgamation lemma §1.651 to the two monics `i : I ↣ B` and `y' : I ↣ C',
    yielding monics `u : B ↣ D`, `w : C' ↣ D` with `i ≫ u = y' ≫ w`.  The pushout square is

  T preserves equalizers (products ⟹ equalizers); T preserves covers (=
  coequalizers, §1.652; T preserves pushouts and 0). -/

/-! ## §1.658 Decidable object

  An object A in a pre-logos is DECIDABLE if the diagonal (1,1): A → A×A
  has a complement in the subobject lattice of A×A.

  Every object in a pre-topos is decidable iff the pre-topos is boolean.

  PROOF SKETCH:
  (⇐) Boolean ⇒ every subobject is complemented, in particular the diagonal.
  (⇒) Given A decidable, let A' → A×B be any subobject; form the equalizer of
      (A' → A×B → B → B×B) and (A' → A×B → A×B → B×B via diag∘second).
      Because pullbacks of complemented subobjects are complemented (§1.658),
      the Boolean algebra structure transfers to all subobjects via slices. -/

/-- **§1.658**: A in a pre-logos is DECIDABLE if the diagonal `diag A : A → A×A`
    has a complement in `Subobject 𝒞 (prod A A)`.
    Lean note: `diag A` is monic (§1.42: `diag_mono`); the subobject is `{ dom := A, arr := diag A, monic := diag_mono A }`. -/

/-- **§1.563 entire-refinement** (the §1.661 gluing engine): if `f : A → C` is a map with

    relation `R' := R ⊓ (graph f ⊚ (graph p)°)` is entire.  (Totality is carried by the map
    `f`; `R` itself need not be entire — in §1.661 it is, which is what supplies `hf`.)

    Constructive proof via the intersection-form modular law (`modular_identity`):
    setting `R, S := graph p, T := graph f` and using `graph f ⊂ R⊚graph p`
    (so `(R⊚graph p) ⊓ graph f = graph f`), modularity gives `graph f ⊂ R' ⊚ graph p`.
    The witnessing `RelHom` provides `h : A → (R'⊚graph p).src` with `h ≫ (R'⊚graph p).colA
    = id_A`, i.e. `(R'⊚graph p).colA` is split epi hence a cover; its left leg factors the
    cover `image.lift` of `R'.colA`, so `R'.colA` is a composite of covers, hence a cover —

/-- **§1.661**: The binary product of two choice objects is choice.
    PROOF (book §1.661): Let R be entire from A to B₁×B₂.
    R∘fst° is entire targeted at B₁, so it contains a map f₁ (`entire_comp_graph` +
    `Choice B₁`).  The *refined* relation R' := R ∩ (f₁∘fst°) is again entire — this is
    the §1.563 intersection-modular content, discharged here Sorry-free by `entire_refine`
    (built on `modular_identity`).  R' pins the B₁-coordinate to f₁ (`comp_recip_pin`),
    so ⟨R'.colA, R'.colB ≫ snd⟩ is jointly monic; its left leg is the cover R'.colA, hence
    the B₂-valued relation R'₂ is entire and `Choice B₂` extracts f₂ *together with a single
    witness `w : A → R'.src`*.  By the pinning, w ≫ R'.colB = pair f₁ f₂, and R' ⊂ R carries
    w into R.src — giving the map ⟨f₁,f₂⟩ ⊂ R.  Fully constructive on `modular_identity`. -/

/-- **§1.662**: (3) → (1): boolean implies binary coproducts of choice objects are choice.
    PROOF: Given S: A → B₁+B₂ entire, the subobject Dom(S∘inl°) ⊆ A is complemented
    (boolean pre-topos). The restriction of S to Dom(S∘inl°) is entire into B₁, so
    contains f₁ (B₁ choice). The restriction to the complement is entire into B₂,
    so contains f₂ (B₂ choice). Then f₁+f₂ (copairing) is a map in S.

    STATUS (Gap C audit): the §1.658 complement layer is now AVAILABLE — `Subobject.Dom`
    (Complement.lean) gives the relation-domain operator, `invImage_complementedSub` +
    `isComplemented_iff_sub` give "Dom(S∘inl°) is complemented", and `modular_identity`
    (§1.563) the gluing.  Two pieces are still genuinely missing and are NOT supplied by
    Complement.lean: (i) a BRIDGE turning the `BinRel` `S ⊚ (graph inl)°` into the
    `Subobject 𝒞 (prod A B₁)` that `Subobject.Dom` consumes (tabulation of a relation as a
    subobject of the product), together with the lemma that RESTRICTING `S` to a complemented
    subobject `D ⊆ A` of its source yields an entire relation `D.dom → B₁`; and (ii) the
    DISJOINT-COPRODUCT copairing that recombines the two restriction-maps `f₁ : D.dom → B₁`,
    `f₂ : Dᶜ.dom → B₂` into a single map `A → B₁+B₂` lying in `S` — this needs `A ≅ D ⊔ Dᶜ`
    from the §1.62 positive/effective structure.  Neither the relation⇄subobject tabulation
    bridge nor the source-restriction-is-entire lemma exists at §1.64.  Faithful statement;
    reduces to those two relation-restriction pieces (the complement layer itself is done). -/
