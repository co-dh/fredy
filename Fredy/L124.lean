  LeetCode 124 — Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM (tupled tree cata).

  Problem: a path is a non-empty sequence of connected nodes that bends AT MOST ONCE (goes up to a
  node then back down); maximise the sum of node values on a path.  Values may be negative; the
  path must have `≥ 1` node.

  This is L104's `TreeCata` engine (`Fredy.A6_TreeBin`) with a TUPLED fold state, the tree analogue
  of L53's suffix/anywhere split:

  1. **Program.**  `foldFn t = (best, gain)`: `gain` is the max sum of a path that STARTS at `t`'s
     root and goes strictly downward (choosing a side at each step, never bending) — `Int`-valued,
     since the empty tree contributes `0` (no extension) and every node contributes at least its
     own label.  `best` is the max sum of ANY path anywhere in `t` — `Option Int`-valued, since the
     EMPTY tree has no path at all (`none`); every non-empty tree's `best` is a `some`, built as the
     three-way `Option`-max of the left subtree's best, the right subtree's best, and the sum of the
     path that bends AT this root (`through = a + max 0 gl + max 0 gr`).

  2. **Specification, two layers (through-root vs in-subtree), the tree analogue of L53's
     suffix/anywhere split.**  `downPath t v` — `v` is achievable by a NON-bending path starting at
     `t`'s root (mirrors `gain`).  `pathSum t v` — `v` is achievable by ANY valid path in `t`: one
     entirely inside the left subtree, one entirely inside the right subtree, or one that bends AT
     the root (a `downPath`-or-skip on each side).  LeetCode 124 asks for `pathSum`'s `≤`-maximum
     among non-empty trees, `max (≤) · Λ pathSum`.

  3. **Correctness.**  `gain_achieves`/`gain_dominates`: `gainFn` is exactly `max (≤) · Λ downPath`
     (refinement + domination, holding for EVERY tree, `nil` included — vacuously, since `downPath
     nil v` is `False`).  `best_achieves`/`best_dominates`: whenever `solveFn t = some m` (always the
     case for a non-empty `t`), `m` is an achievable `pathSum` and dominates every achievable
     `pathSum` — proved by ONE structural induction on `t`, using `gain_achieves`/`gain_dominates` to
     bound the through-root layer and a small `omax` case-split lemma (`omax_eq_or`) for the
     three-way choice in `best`.
