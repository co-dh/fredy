  LeetCode 53 — Maximum Subarray (Kadane's algorithm) — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM,
  derived through the generic running-best driver `Fredy.AutoDerive`.

  Problem: given a non-empty array of integers `x₀,…,x_{n-1}` (possibly negative), find the maximum
  sum over all NON-EMPTY contiguous subarrays.  (The empty subarray is not allowed, so an
  all-negative array's answer is its largest single element.)

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L121.lean`:

  1. **Data** — the array is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ`
     (`Fredy.A6_SnocList`); `wrap x` is a single-element array, `snoc xs p` appends `p`.

  2. **Program** — Kadane's sweep is the fold with state `(bestEndingHere, bestSoFar)` and algebra
     `[ x ↦ (x,x),  ((e,b),p) ↦ (max p (e+p), max b (max p (e+p))) ]`.  We package it as a `Map`
     `solve : Arr ⟶ ℤ` in `Rel(Set)` and prove it *is* the catamorphism of that algebra followed by
     the second projection (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — two mutually-referencing relations: `suffixSum xs v` says `v` is the sum of
     some non-empty SUFFIX of `xs` (a subarray ending at the last element); `subSum xs v` says `v` is
     the sum of ANY non-empty contiguous subarray of `xs` — either a subarray of the prefix, or a
     suffix.  `spec = subSum` is the transpose `Λ⁻¹ spec`, and LeetCode 53 asks for its `≤`-maximum,
     `max (≤) · Λ spec`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum (`solve_correct`, `solve_eq_maxRel`).
     Every relational side condition of the greedy derivation (`prodDom_trans`, `alg_mono`,
     `alg_le_gen`, `gen_recip_alg_le`, `alg_ref`, `cataFold_alg`, `gen_total` — formerly ~104
     hand-written lines here) is discharged by the `RunningBest` driver from the bundle `kadane`
     below; this file supplies only the CREATIVE content: the bundle's fields and the
     generator-vs-spec characterisation (`gen_sound`/`diag_gen`/`spec_gen`), the genuinely
     problem-specific inductions saying the search space is exactly the set of subarray sums.

  Mathlib-free.  Axioms of the headline: {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} — the
  `Classical.choice` is the honest cost of the relational-catamorphism universal property,
  inherited via `cataR_eq_relCata`.
