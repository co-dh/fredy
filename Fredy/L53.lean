  LeetCode 53 — Maximum Subarray (Kadane's algorithm) — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a non-empty array of integers `x₀,…,x_{n-1}` (possibly negative), find the maximum
  sum over all NON-EMPTY contiguous subarrays.  (The empty subarray is not allowed, so an
  all-negative array's answer is its largest single element.)

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L121.lean` (see `Fredy/leetcode.md`, skill S0):

  1. **Data** — the array is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ`
     (`Fredy.A6_SnocList`); `wrap x` is a single-element array, `snoc xs p` appends `p`.

  2. **Program** — Kadane's sweep is the fold with state `(bestEndingHere, bestSoFar)` and algebra
     `[ x ↦ (x,x),  ((e,b),p) ↦ (max p (e+p), max b (max p (e+p))) ]`.  We package it as a `Map`
     `solve : Arr ⟶ ℤ` in `Rel(Set)` and prove it *is* the catamorphism of that algebra followed by
     the second projection (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — two mutually-referencing relations: `suffixSum xs v` says `v` is the sum of
     some non-empty SUFFIX of `xs` (a subarray ending at the last element); `subSum xs v` says `v` is
     the sum of ANY non-empty contiguous subarray of `xs` — either a subarray of the prefix, or a
     suffix.  `spec = subSum` is the transpose `Λ⁻¹ spec`, and LeetCode 53 asks for its `≤`-maximum,
     `max (≤) · Λ spec`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum: it returns an achievable subarray sum
     (`solve_sub`, giving `solve ⊑ spec`) and dominates every achievable subarray sum. Together
     (`solve_correct`) this is `solve = max (≤) · Λ spec`.

  Mathlib-free.  Correctness now flows from the GREEDY THEOREM (`A7_4_Horner.horner_correct`), so
  the headline axioms are {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} — the `Classical.choice` is the
  honest cost of the relational-catamorphism universal property, inherited via `cataR_eq_relCata`.

/-! ## The greedy route: Kadane's fold as the projection of a Pareto optimum

  Kadane's answer is NOT a scalar catamorphism (`bestSoFar` needs `bestEndingHere`), and its
  scalar step is not `≤`-monotone — so the plain greedy theorem does not apply to the headline
  scalar directly.  The genuine route (built once in `Fredy.A7_4_Horner`): the PAIR algebra is
  monotone on the PRODUCT (Pareto) order, so the greedy theorem `A7_2.greedy_max` (through
  `greedy_max_of_refinement`) puts the fold inside the Pareto frontier of a non-deterministic
  GENERATOR `gen`, and the scalar answer is the frontier's second component.  Below: the generator,
  the three greedy hypotheses (product monotonicity, transitivity, greedy-step refinement), and the
  "generator = spec" characterisation; `horner_correct` assembles them. -/

/-- `imax` is monotone in both arguments. -/

/-- The non-deterministic GENERATOR `S` whose Pareto frontier the deterministic fold computes: at a
    leaf, the sole pair `(x,x)`; at a `snoc`, the running suffix `e` becomes `p` or `e+p`, and the
    best `b` is kept or reset to the new suffix `e`.  `alg` is one deterministic choice inside it. -/
