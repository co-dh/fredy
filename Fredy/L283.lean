  LeetCode 283 — Move Zeroes — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: move all `0`s in `nums : List Int` to the end while keeping the relative order of the
  non-zero elements (a STABLE partition).

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L238.lean` (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S0/S23): plain `List Int`, no `SnocList`
  engine needed — the program is a one-shot filter+append, not a scan/fold.

  1. **Data** — a plain `List Int`; the answer object is the SAME type.

  2. **Program** — `moveZeroesFn xs := xs.filter nzPred ++ List.replicate (xs.filter zPred).length 0`
     — the non-zero elements in order, then that many `0`s appended.

  3. **Specification — full honesty, four clauses**:
     * non-zeros preserved in order: `(moveZeroesFn xs).filter nzPred = xs.filter nzPred`.
     * same length: `(moveZeroesFn xs).length = xs.length`.
     * multiset preserved: `∀ v, countL (moveZeroesFn xs) v = countL xs v` (nothing lost/invented —
       pins that the appended zeros exactly replace the removed ones; reuses `LC242.countL`).
     * all zeros trailing, via the DEFINITIONAL split `moveZeroesFn xs = xs.filter nzPred ++
       List.replicate k 0` (the program's own shape, witness `k := (xs.filter zPred).length`)
       together with "the first part has no zeros" (`filter_nz_no_zero`) — the cleaner of the two
       forms `leetcode.md` allows, since the index-chasing form is a re-derivation of exactly this.

  4. **Correctness** — the crux fact underlying all four clauses: `xs.filter zPred = List.replicate
     (xs.filter zPred).length 0` (every element `zPred` keeps IS `0`, via core `List.eq_replicate_iff`).
     This turns `moveZeroesFn xs` into `xs.filter nzPred ++ xs.filter zPred`
     (`moveZeroesFn_eq_partition`) — a genuine STABLE PARTITION of `xs` by `nzPred`, whose
     order/length/multiset preservation reduces to one small reusable partition law per invariant
     (`filter_not_filter_eq_nil`, `length_filter_add_filter_not`, `countL_filter_add_filter_not`),
     each a short structural induction, plus core `List.filter_append`/`filter_filter`/
     `length_append`. Headline `move_correct` bundles all four. Package `solve := graph moveZeroesFn`
     (a `Map`) for the `Rel(Set)` framing.

/-! ## Reusable partition laws: a predicate split by its own negation recovers the whole list -/

/-- Filtering the "fails `p`" half of a list BY `p` gives nothing — `p` and `¬p` are disjoint. -/

    | false => simp only [List.filter_cons, hb, Bool.not_false, if_true]; exact ih

/-- Splitting a list by `p` and by `¬p`, then summing the two lengths, recovers the whole length. -/

/-! ## Correctness: the four honest clauses -/

/-- **Non-zeros preserved in order**: filtering the program's output for non-zeros gives back
    exactly `xs`'s non-zeros, in the same order — the program neither reorders nor drops any of
    them. -/

  exact length_filter_add_filter_not nzPred xs

/-- **Multiset preserved**: every value occurs the same number of times in the output as in the
    input — nothing lost, nothing invented; pins that the appended zeros exactly replace the
    removed ones. -/
theorem moveZeroesFn_countL (xs : List Int) (v : Int) :

/-- **Headline correctness**: `moveZeroesFn` is an honest stable partition of `xs` by `nzPred` —
    non-zeros preserved in order, same length, same multiset, and all zeros trailing (the split
    `moveZeroesFn xs = xs.filter nzPred ++ List.replicate k 0` is the program's own definition;
    only "the first part has no zeros" needs proving on top of it). -/
theorem move_correct (xs : List Int) :
    (moveZeroesFn xs).filter nzPred = xs.filter nzPred ∧
    (moveZeroesFn xs).length = xs.length ∧
    (∀ v, LC242.countL (moveZeroesFn xs) v = LC242.countL xs v) ∧
