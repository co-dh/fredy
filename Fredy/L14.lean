  LeetCode 14 — Longest Common Prefix — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given `strs : List (List Int)` (strings as code-lists), return their longest common
  prefix.

  1. **Program** — `commonPrefix2 a b` is the longest shared prefix of two lists (structural
     recursion, peeling matching heads); `lcpFn` folds `commonPrefix2` right-to-left over `strs`,
     `[] ↦ []`, a singleton returned verbatim.
  2. **Specification** — Lean core's `List.IsPrefix` (`<+:`, `p <+: s ↔ ∃ t, p ++ t = s`) IS the
     honest "is a prefix of" relation; no hand-rolled substitute needed.  LeetCode's "the
     LONGEST common prefix" is the `<+:`-GREATEST element of `{p | ∀ s ∈ strs, p <+: s}` — the
     prefix order itself is the extremum, no numeric `max` required.
  3. **Correctness** — soundness (`lcpFn strs` is itself a common prefix, unconditional) and
     maximality (every common prefix of `strs` is a prefix of `lcpFn strs`), both riding on one
     crux fact about `commonPrefix2`: it is the `<+:`-meet of two lists — itself a common prefix
     of both (`commonPrefix2_prefix`), and dominated below by every OTHER common prefix
     (`commonPrefix2_greatest`).  Maximality genuinely needs `strs ≠ []` (LeetCode's own
     constraint `1 ≤ strs.length`) — see the note on `lcp_max` below for why the empty case is
     NOT "vacuously true" as one might first assume.

  Mathlib-free; fully constructive — axioms `{propext, Quot.sound}` (the `Rel(Set)` packaging's
  usual cost; the core `lcp_correct` theorem itself needs neither).

/-! ## Correctness: soundness (unconditional) and maximality (`strs ≠ []`) -/

/-- **Soundness**: `lcpFn strs` is a common prefix of every string in `strs` — holds
    unconditionally, even at `strs = []` (vacuously, there is no `s` to check). -/
theorem lcp_sound : ∀ strs : List (List Int), ∀ s ∈ strs, lcpFn strs <+: s := by
  intro strs
  induction strs with
  | nil => intro s hs; exact absurd hs not_mem_nil
  | cons s rest ih =>
    cases rest with
    | nil =>

      · rw [heq]; exact (commonPrefix2_prefix s (lcpFn (s2 :: rest2))).1
      · exact IsPrefix.trans (commonPrefix2_prefix s (lcpFn (s2 :: rest2))).2 (ih t hmem)

/-- **Maximality**: every common prefix `p` of a NONEMPTY `strs` is a prefix of `lcpFn strs` —
    i.e. `lcpFn strs` is the `<+:`-GREATEST common prefix, matching "LONGEST".  `strs ≠ []` is
    load-bearing here, and NOT for the reason one might first guess: at `strs = []` the
    hypothesis `∀ s ∈ strs, p <+: s` is vacuously TRUE for *every* `p` (there is no `s` to
    falsify it against), so unrestricted maximality would force `p <+: lcpFn [] = []`, i.e.
    `p = []`, for an ARBITRARY `p` — which is simply false (take `p = [1]`).  The vacuous
    HYPOTHESIS does not make the CONCLUSION vacuous; only the hypothesis-side is vacuous. Adding
    `strs ≠ []` is exactly LeetCode's own constraint `1 ≤ strs.length`. -/
theorem lcp_max : ∀ strs : List (List Int), strs ≠ [] →
    ∀ p, (∀ s ∈ strs, p <+: s) → p <+: lcpFn strs := by
  intro strs

  | nil => intro hne; exact absurd rfl hne

      exact commonPrefix2_greatest s (lcpFn (s2 :: rest2)) p hps hpRest

/-- **Headline**: `lcpFn` computes the longest common prefix of a nonempty list of strings —
    soundness (it IS a common prefix) and maximality (it is the LONGEST one). -/
theorem lcp_correct (strs : List (List Int)) (hne : strs ≠ []) :
    (∀ s ∈ strs, lcpFn strs <+: s) ∧ (∀ p, (∀ s ∈ strs, p <+: s) → p <+: lcpFn strs) :=
