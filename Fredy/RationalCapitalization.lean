  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §1.48 / §1.547
  THE RATIONAL CATEGORY `A[𝒟⁻¹]` AS A CALCULUS-OF-FRACTIONS CATEGORY,
  and the CHOICE-FREE relative capitalization `A ⊆ A*` of §1.547.

  ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (milestone R1) ────────────────────────────────────────

  The transfinite §1.546 capitalization (`CapitalizationTransfinite.lean`) and the
  ω-tower §1.544/§1.545 successor (`Capitalization.lean`, `RelativeCapitalization.lean`)
  both model `A*` as a *directed colimit of slice categories* — a `Colim.CatSystem`.
  That framework demands the directed transitions be **strictly** functorial
  (`CatSystem.F_refl : F (refl) X = X` and `F_trans` on the nose, CatColimit.lean:33).
  The §1.547 transition `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` for `V ⊆ U` is BASE-CHANGE (the pullback that
  grows the embedding domain `B×∏V ↝ B×∏U`); base-change is only *pseudo*-functorial,
  so `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` are FALSE for it (machine-checked, documented at
  `RelativeCapitalization.lean` `StrictBaseChange`/ROUTE-1).  Hence the slice-colimit
  model of `A*` hits a strictness wall, NOT sidestepped by §1.547.

  This file takes the OTHER route the book actually uses (§1.48, and which §1.547 cites):
  build the rational category `A[𝒟⁻¹]` **directly** as a calculus-of-fractions category —
  same objects as `A`; a morphism `A → B` is an equivalence class of spans
  `A ←[denom ∈ 𝒟]— • —num→ B`; composition by pullback.  There is NO directed colimit
  and hence NO transition-strictness obligation: the rational category is a *single*
  `Cat` built by quotienting each hom-set.  This is exactly why §1.547 phrases the
  inter-slice transitions as equivalences (up-to-iso) yet still gets a genuine category.

  ── WHAT THIS FILE DELIVERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The §1.48 scaffolding (`DenseClass`/`Fraction`/`FractionEquiv`/`RationalCategory`)
  already lives in `S1_47.lean` as DEFINITIONS + a universal-property record, but the
  actual category (composition by pullback, well-definedness, the `Cat` instance) was
  never built.  Here:

    * `denseMonos 𝒞`          — SORRY-FREE (`propext` only).  The dense class of ALL
                                monics (closed under iso/comp/pb; §1.48(i)-(iii) from
                                `mono_pullback`).  The working dense class for `A[𝒟⁻¹]`.
    * `FractionEquiv` EQUIVALENCE RELATION — SORRY-FREE over `denseMonos 𝒞`.  Reflexivity,
                                symmetry, AND transitivity all proven; transitivity closes
                                via the pullback-roof whose dense leg is monic because
                                `r₁`,`s₂` are mono left-factors and pullbacks of monics are
                                monic (`mono_of_comp_mono`/`mono_pullback`/`mono_comp'`).
    * `RatHom A B`/`ratId`/`locMap` — SORRY-FREE (`propext`).  `Quotient (fractionSetoid …)`,
                                the hom-set of `A[𝒟⁻¹]`; identity span; localisation of an
                                ordinary arrow.
    * `compFraction`         — SORRY-FREE.  The composite span by pullback of `(num₁,denom₂)`,
                                with its denominator dense by pb+comp closure.
    * `ratComp`              — SORRY-FREE (milestone R2).  Composition on equivalence classes;
                                the `Quotient.lift₂` WELL-DEFINEDNESS (independence of names +
                                pullback choice, §1.48) is discharged by the two single-span
                                congruences `compFraction_congr_left`/`_right` (each a single
                                pullback roof) glued by `fractionEquiv_trans`.  Axioms: `propext`,
                                `Quot.sound`.
    * `compFraction_idFraction_left/right`, `compFraction_assoc` — SORRY-FREE (R2).  Unit and
                                associativity laws of `compFraction` up to `FractionEquiv`.
    * `Rat 𝒞` / `ratCat`     — SORRY-FREE (R2).  The rational category `A[denseMonos⁻¹]` as a
                                genuine `Cat` (objects = a structure wrapper of `𝒞`'s objects so
                                its `Cat` instance does not collapse onto `𝒞`'s; homs = `RatHom`;
                                comp = `ratComp`; the three laws lifted from `compFraction`).
    * `locFunctor`           — SORRY-FREE (R2).  The localisation functor `T_𝒟 : 𝒞 → A[denseMonos⁻¹]`
                                (identity on objects, `f ↦ locMap f`); `map_id` definitional,
                                `map_comp` via `locMap_comp_equiv` (pullback-against-identity roof).
    * FAITHFULNESS FINDING (R2, machine-checked) — at the ALL-MONICS class, `T_𝒟` is NEITHER an
                                `Embedding` (left-cancelling a dense MONIC roof leg would need it
                                EPIC) NOR conservative (it inverts every monic).  So the repo's
                                `Faithful` — hence `CapStep.stepFaithful`, hence a genuine
                                `ratCap S : CapStep S` with `step = T_𝒟` — is GATED on §1.547's
                                dense-class refinement (invert only the slice-embedding monics).
                                No `ratCap` is asserted here: doing so at this class would require
                                faking `stepFaithful`, which the integrity rules forbid.  See the
                                "§1.547 FAITHFULNESS FINDING" block at the localisation section.
    * Cartesian / pre-regular `PreRegularCategory (Rat 𝒞)` — NOT built in R2.  Transporting
                                finite limits + covers through `T_𝒟` is a large separate effort
                                and, per the faithfulness finding, would still not yield `ratCap`
                                without the refined class; left for R3 rather than stubbed.
    * `ratStep_points_every_factor` / `slice_factor_point_acquired` — SORRY-FREE.  The §1.547
                                per-step PAYOFF: the product-slice `A/(∏U)` carries a global
                                point of every factor (re-exposed `listProdSliceAcquiresEvery
                                Factor`).
    * `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` — the §1.547 well-pointedness CORE, stated with the
                                slice's genuine `HasTerminal` (overHasTerminal) — NO sorry in
                                the type, so it is the book's real `WellPointed`.  The descent
                                of an arbitrary subobject to the downstairs proper `B'` and the
                                missed-point extraction is the isolated `sorry`.

  ── MILESTONE R3 (§1.547 pairs category + refined dense class + FAITHFULNESS) ──────

    * `PairObj`/`PairHom`/`pairsCat` — the §1.547 INTERMEDIATE category `Â`: objects `(A,F)` with
                                `F` a finite set of morphisms to well-supported targets; morphisms
                                `g : A₁→A₂` with `F₂° ⊆ F₁°` and the compatibility square.  A
                                genuine `Cat`, SORRY-FREE, NO axioms (homs determined by `g`).
    * `pairForget`/`pairForget_embedding` — the forgetful `Â → A` is a functor and an `Embedding`
                                (faithful by `PairHom.ext`).  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.
    * `PairDense` — the §1.547 REFINED dense class: `x` is dense iff it + the surviving factors
                                form a PRODUCT DIAGRAM (witnessed by `X.A ≅ Y.A × W`, `W` the
                                well-supported product of surviving targets, `x.g = fst`).
    * `pairDense_cover` — every dense morphism's underlying arrow is a COVER (`fst` onto a
                                well-supported factor; `prod_fst_cover`+`cover_precomp_iso`).
                                SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.  This is the cancellability R2 lacked.
    * `pairDense_of_iso`/`pairDense_of_isIso` (isos dense) and `pairDense_comp` (dense closed
                                under composition, surviving object `W_y × Wₓ`) — the dense-class
                                closure laws.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms (choice-free).
    * `pairDense_epi` / **`pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`** — THE DECISIVE R3 RESULT:
                                dense morphisms are EPIC in `Â` (their underlying cover is epic,
                                `cover_epi`), so two parallel `Â`-arrows identified by a common
                                DENSE roof are equal — this IS the FAITHFULNESS of the §1.547
                                localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹] = A*`.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms,
                                choice-free.  R2's all-monics route FAILED exactly here (a monic
                                roof leg is not epic); §1.547's product-projection dense legs are
                                covers, hence epic — faithfulness re-established.

  ── MILESTONE R4 (§1.547 `Â` IS CARTESIAN — terminal + binary products, sorry-free) ──────────────

    * `WideEq`/`wideEqNil`/`wideEqCons`/`wideEq` — the reusable WIDE EQUALIZER of a finite LIST of
                                parallel pairs over `X`: the maximal subobject `w : D ↪ X`
                                equalizing all listed pairs, universal.  Built by iterated binary
                                equalizer (`products_pullbacks_implies_equalizers`).  This is the
                                `D ↪ A₁×A₂` kernel of Freyd's §1.547 product formula.  SORRY-FREE,
                                choice-free (`propext`,`Quot.sound`).
    * `pairHasTerminal` — `Â` HAS A TERMINAL OBJECT `(1,∅)` (terminator of `A`, no factors); the
                                unique arrow is `term`, unique by `term_uniq`.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.
    * `crossConstraints`/`pairProdD`/`pairProdW`/`pairProdK`/`pairProdObj` — the §1.547 PRODUCT
                                OBJECT `(A₁,F₁)×(A₂,F₂) = (D,K)`: `D = wideEq` of the cross
                                constraints `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for matched factors `f∈F₁`,`f'∈F₂`
                                (`f°=f'°`, decided by `DecidableEq 𝒞` = Freyd's "equal targets"),
                                `w : D ↪ A₁×A₂`, `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  Projections `pairProjFst/Snd`.
                                SORRY-FREE, choice-free.
    * `pairProd_hom_ext` — UNIQUENESS of the product pairing (unconditional): agreement after both
                                projections + `w` monic + `prod_hom_ext` ⟹ equality.  SORRY-FREE.
    * `pairPair`/`pairPair_fst`/`pairPair_snd`/`pairProd_lift` — EXISTENCE of the pairing (data,
                                choice-free) under the book's target-distinctness `Z.DistinctTargets`.
    * `PairTargetsDistinct` + `pairHasBinaryProducts` — `Â` HAS BINARY PRODUCTS, under the book's
                                STANDING ASSUMPTION (`PairTargetsDistinct 𝒞`: every object of `Â`
                                has factors to DISTINCT targets — Freyd builds this into objects of
                                `Â`; R3's `PairObj` recorded only well-supportedness, so it is made
                                an explicit class here, NOT a weakening).  SORRY-FREE, choice-free.

  THE DISTINCTNESS GATE — RESOLVED (R5).  Freyd's §1.547 objects of `Â` carry factors to DISTINCT
  well-supported targets.  R5 adds distinctness as a FIELD of `PairObj` (`PairObj.distinct`), NOT a
  side class.  Reason: `nextStep : ∀ S, CapStep S` must be unconditional in `S`, and `PairObj S` is
  free to list two factors to one target, so a standing class `PairTargetsDistinct S` is NOT derivable
  for arbitrary `S` — only by recording distinctness on the object itself is the §1.547 product
  pairing total with no hypothesis.  Hence `pairHasBinaryProducts` is now UNCONDITIONAL, and the
  whole pre-regular structure (below) needs no extra typeclass on `S` beyond `S`'s own pre-regularity.

  ── MILESTONE R5 (§1.547 `Â` PRE-REGULAR + refined dense class; pullbacks/equalizers sorry-free) ──

    * `pairHasEqualizers`/`pairHasPullbacks` — `Â` HAS EQUALIZERS and PULLBACKS, UNCONDITIONAL,
                                SORRY-FREE.  The equalizer of `a,b : (A,F)→(B,G)` is `(E, e^*F)` with
                                `e = eqMap a.g b.g` and `e^*F` the factor set pulled back along `e`
                                (`pairForget` CREATES equalizers); pullbacks by §1.432
                                (products+equalizers ⟹ pullbacks).
    * `pairCover_underlying` — SORRY-FREE.  An `Â`-cover has an `A`-cover underlying arrow: any
                                `A`-monic `m` factoring `f.g` LIFTS to an `Â`-monic (`liftObj`/
                                `liftMono`, factor set `m^*F`) factoring `f`, so the `Â`-cover forces
                                `m` iso.  Freyd's "`pairForget` preserves covers", forward half.
    * `pairPullbacksTransferCovers` / `pairPreRegular` — `Â` IS `PreRegularCategory`.  The cover
                                TRANSFER is the one isolated obstruction: its STATEMENT is the genuine
                                §1.52 condition; the forward bridge reduces the underlying square to
                                `A`'s transfer, but promoting back to an `Â`-cover is the direction
                                `pairForget` does NOT reflect monos — exactly Freyd's slice-equivalence
                                verification ("`A*` = directed union of pre-regular slices", §1.547 =
                                the directed-colimit route's strictness wall, R1).  ONE `sorry`, true
                                statement, sharply documented.
    * `pairEmbed`/`pairEmbed_faithful` — SORRY-FREE.  The §1.547 FULL EMBEDDING `A ↪ Â`, `A ↦ (A,∅)`,
                                full + faithful (the `S → Â` half of the capitalization `step`).
    * `pairDenseClass : DenseClass (PairObj 𝒞)` — the refined §1.547 dense class packaged as the
                                record the §1.48 rational category consumes: `mem := Nonempty PairDense`,
                                isos dense + composition-closed sorry-free (R3); `pairDense_pb` (§1.48(iii)
                                pullback-closure: base change of a product projection is a projection onto
                                the same well-supported `W`) the one isolated obstruction, true statement.

  ── MILESTONE R6/R7 (generic monic skeleton; EVERY DENSE MORPHISM IS MONIC IN `Â`) ────────────────

    * `MonicDense 𝒟` / `denseMonos_monic` / `MonicDense.leg_mono` — the calculus-of-fractions skeleton
                                GENERALISED.  R2 hard-wired `fractionEquiv_trans`/`fractionSetoid`/`ratComp`
                                to `denseMonos`; `fractionEquiv_trans` is now generic over ANY monic dense
                                class `(𝒟, hD : MonicDense 𝒟)` (members ↔ monics), with `denseMonos` the
                                canonical instance re-fed downstream.  Sorry-free (`propext`); `ratCat`
                                keeps its `propext`/`Quot.sound` profile.
    * `pairDense_monic` — **R7 KEYSTONE, machine-checked AXIOM-FREE.**  EVERY DENSE MORPHISM IS MONIC
                                IN `Â` (Freyd §1.547: "every dense morphism is monic").  The dense `x`'s
                                product-diagram form `X.A ≅ Y.A × W` with `x.g = fst` makes it monic-in-`Â`:
                                its `W`-component is PINNED by `X`'s factor data (`PairDense.survPinned` —
                                `W = ∏(surviving targets)`, each a factor of `X`, so any `Â`-map into `X`
                                agrees there by compatibility + distinctness).  The UNDERLYING `A`-arrow is
                                an epic cover (`pairDense_cover`), but `pairForget` does not reflect monos,
                                so monic-in-`Â` ≠ monic-in-`A` — no contradiction.  R6 mistook the former
                                for the latter ("monic/epic collapse", "need a dual co-span calculus");
                                that was a CATEGORY CONFUSION, now corrected.  `pairDenseClass_mem_mono`
                                packages `pairDenseClass` as a §1.48/§1.481 DENSE CLASS OF MONICS;
                                `pairDense_monic_and_epic` states both halves (monic + faithful-cancel).

  STILL OPEN (the `ratCap` spill, NOT faked).  `ratCap S : CapStep S` is NOT yet assembled.  With R7,
  `pairDenseClass` is correctly a dense class of MONICS, so the §1.48 monic LEFT-fraction skeleton is the
  right tool (no dual calculus).  What remains for a full sorry-free instantiation: (a) `pairDense_pb`
  (§1.48(iii) dense pullback-closure, isolated sorry); (b) the §1.48 calculus-of-fractions SATURATION of
  the transitivity roof rebuild for a PROPER monic class (the all-monics `MonicDense` rebuild uses
  `Mono → mem`, false for `pairDenseClass`; the standard §1.48 Ore argument is needed instead); (c)
  `pairPullbacksTransferCovers` (the `Â` cover transfer).  No fake `ratCap` is asserted.  The
  faithfulness obligation is already discharged (`pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`/`pairDense_epi`);
  the embedding half is `pairEmbed_faithful`.

  ── INTEGRITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  No `axiom`, no `: True`, no `sorry` on a false statement, no `sorry` in any STATEMENT/type.
  THREE `sorry`s, each on the book's genuine statement, sharply documented: (1) the R2 residual
  `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` (§1.547 subobject-descent); (2) `pairPullbacksTransferCovers` (the
  `Â` cover transfer = slice equivalence); (3) `pairDense_pb_canonical_dense` (§1.48(iii) leg-density).

  ── R9 (dense-pullback-closure: reduction done, residual sharply isolated) ──────────────────────

  `pairDense_pb` (§1.48(iii) `DenseClass.pb_mem` for `PairDense`) is now SORRY-FREE *modulo* a single
  isolated sub-lemma.  R9 split it:
    * `pairDense_pb_witness` — produces the genuine `Â`-pullback cone of the cospan `(g, x)` and proves
      `c.IsPullback` (both SORRY-FREE — the cone is the canonical `pairHasPullbacks` pullback).
    * `pairDense_pb` itself — SORRY-FREE: transports density across the canonical pullback.
    * `pairDense_pb_canonical_dense` — the ONLY residual `sorry`: the first leg `canonical.π₁` is dense,
      i.e. the canonical `Â`-pullback apex is `≅ Z.A × dx.W` (base change of the product projection
      `fst` onto the SAME well-supported `W`), with `survPinned` discharged via `dx.survPinned` pulled
      back along `canonical.π₂`.  THE GAP (machine-verified, R9): the underlying `A`-object of the
      canonical `Â`-pullback is the wide-equalizer subobject `pairEqObj … (pairProdObj Z X)` of
      `Z.A × X.A`, and proving it `≅ Z.A × dx.W` is exactly "`pairForget` preserves this pullback" —
      Freyd's §1.547 slice-equivalence verification, the SAME content as `pairPullbacksTransferCovers`.
      From the abstract `PairObj`/`PairDense` data alone (which permits `Z` and `X` to record unrelated
      factors to a shared well-supported target) the cross-collision cannot be ruled out, so the naive
      `prod Z.A dx.W` apex with a union factor list is an ILLEGAL `PairObj` (its `distinct` reduces to
      an unprovable cross goal `fst≫f = π₂g≫f'`).  Not faked, not weakened — isolated honestly.

  `pairDense_monic` (the R7 keystone) is sorry-free AND axiom-free.  The protected types of
  `capData_exists`/`CapData`/`CapStep` are not touched.  No fake `ratCap` (it spills to R10: the
  unconditional `CapStep S` assembly gates on (3) above + the §1.48 composition-congruence saturation
  + `PreRegularCategory A*` transport).

  ── R10 (slice-equivalence A-LEVEL CORE proven; the two §1.547 residuals confirmed identical) ──────

  R10 targeted the §1.547 slice-equivalence fact that R9 isolated as the shared content of BOTH
  `pairDense_pb_canonical_dense` AND `pairPullbacksTransferCovers`.  Result:

    * `projBaseChangeCone`/`projBaseChangeCone_isPullback` — SORRY-FREE, AXIOM-FREE.  The genuine
      `A`-level core: the pullback of a PRODUCT PROJECTION `fst : Y×W → Y` along any `g : Z → Y` is
      the projection `fst : Z×W → Z` (apex `Z×W`, `π₂ = pair (fst≫g) snd`).  Constructive, needs only
      binary products.  This is exactly the `A`-shape a dense `Â`-pullback descends to
      (`X.A ≅ Y.A × W`, `x.g = fst`), so it is the reusable honest core of both payoffs.

    * CONFIRMED (machine-checked reasoning, NOT faked): both residuals are the SAME gap.  With the
      `A`-level core in hand, each reduces to a single PRESERVATION/REFLECTION step for `pairForget`
      on this one pullback: the canonical `Â`-pullback apex `E` is the wide-equalizer of `Z.A × X.A`
      cutting BOTH the square `eq(fst≫g.g, snd≫x.g)` AND the product cross-constraints, whereas the
      EXPECTED `A`-pullback (`projBaseChangeCone`) cuts the square ONLY.  `pairForget` preserves this
      pullback ⟺ the cross-constraints add nothing ⟺ no two UNRELATED factors `f∈Z.F`, `f'∈X.F` of a
      common well-supported target collide.  Freyd's set-based ambient gives this; abstract `PairObj`
      data (which permits unrelated shared-target factors) does not.  So neither residual is derivable
      sorry-free from the abstract data — this is genuinely Freyd's slice-equivalence verification,
      the directed-colimit route's strictness wall (R1) in a different guise.  Both docstrings now
      cite `projBaseChangeCone_isPullback` and the precise residual; both `sorry`s carry the book's
      true statement, sharply documented.  Sorry count UNCHANGED at 3 (the two coincident slice-
      equivalence residuals + the R2 `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed`); the honest reduction — not a
      removal — is R10's contribution, since faking either would violate the integrity rule.

/-! ## §1.48  The dense class of ALL monics

  Freyd's §1.48 dense class needs only (i) all isos, (ii) closure under composition,
  (iii) closure under pullback.  The class of *all* monics satisfies these: isos are
  monic, monics compose, and the pullback of a monic is monic (`mono_pullback`,
  S1_45.lean).  §1.547's "dense monics" are a *sub*-class of this (the dense morphisms
  `x` that, with the surviving factors, form a product diagram); for the rational
  category as a localisation we may take the largest dense class that still inverts what
  we need — and the all-monics class is the cleanest concrete instance, sorry-free. -/

/-! ## §1.48  `FractionEquiv` is an equivalence relation

  Two fraction spans name the same morphism of `A[𝒟⁻¹]` iff they share a common
  dense-monic roof commuting both squares (`FractionEquiv`, S1_47.lean).  We show this
  is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive — so the hom-set is a genuine `Quotient`.
  Reflexivity: the identity roof (`id ∈ 𝒟`).  Symmetry: swap the roof legs.
  Transitivity: the pullback of the two roofs, glued over the shared apex; the composite
  denominator stays in `𝒟` by the dense class's composition + pullback closure. -/

  With `FractionEquiv` reflexive + symmetric (above), the hom-set `A[𝒟⁻¹](A,B)` is the
  quotient of fraction spans.  Transitivity (needed for `Quotient`) is the dense-class
  pullback-roof argument, isolated below as `fractionEquiv_trans` with its precise
  obstruction. -/

/-! ### §1.48  GENERALISING THE SKELETON — the monic dense-class interface `MonicDense`

  R2 hard-wired the calculus-of-fractions (equivalence, composition, well-definedness, units,
  associativity, localisation functor) to `denseMonos 𝒞`.  In fact the §1.48 proofs use only:
  (i) the three `DenseClass` closures (`iso_mem`/`comp_mem`/`pb_mem`); and (ii) `𝒟.mem f ↔ Mono f`,
  to extract `Mono` from a dense roof leg (`mono_of_comp_mono`) and to repackage the rebuilt roof
  denominator as dense.  We isolate (ii) as `MonicDense 𝒟` and parametrise the skeleton over a
  GENERIC monic dense class `𝒟` with `(hD : MonicDense 𝒟)`.  `denseMonos` is the canonical instance
  (`denseMonos_monic`, `mem ↔ Mono` is `Iff.rfl`); the all-monics development of R2 is recovered by
  feeding `denseMonos`/`denseMonos_monic` (`fractionSetoid` etc. below).

  THE ALL-MONICS INSTANCE vs THE REFINED CLASS (R7 correction).  `MonicDense` as stated requires
  `mem ↔ Mono`, i.e. the dense class is ALL monics; transitivity then rebuilds the roof denominator
  `π ≫ r ≫ d` by extracting `Mono r` from `Mono (r ≫ d)`, pulling the mono through the pullback, and
  repackaging via `mem ↔ Mono`.  §1.547's refined dense class `pairDenseClass` is a PROPER class of
  monics: its members ARE `Mono` in `Â` (`pairDenseClass_mem_mono`, via `pairDense_monic` — the book's
  "every dense morphism is monic"), but the REVERSE `Mono → mem` is false (not every `Â`-monic is a
  product projection).  So `pairDenseClass` is NOT the all-monics `MonicDense` instance; it is the
  §1.48 "dense class of monics" closed under iso/comp/pullback (`pairDenseClass`).  R6 wrongly read the
  underlying-`A`-arrow's epi-ness (`pairDense_cover`/`pairDense_epi`) as failure of monic-in-`Â` and
  concluded a dual co-span calculus was needed; that was a CATEGORY CONFUSION (`pairForget` does not
  reflect monos, so monic-in-`Â` ≠ monic-in-`A`).  The monic LEFT-fraction skeleton IS the right tool
  for `A* = Â[pairDense⁻¹]`; what remains for a full instantiation on `pairDenseClass` is the §1.48
  calculus-of-fractions saturation of the roof rebuild for a proper monic class (the dense roof leg
  `r` with `r ≫ d` dense need not have `π ≫ r ≫ d` dense from the bare `DenseClass` closures alone —
  this is the standard Ore/§1.48 condition, NOT the false monic/epic wall).  See `pairDense_monic`,
  `pairDenseClass_mem_mono`, `pairDense_monic_and_epic`. -/

/-! ## §1.48  Composition by pullback

  The composite of spans `A ←[d₁]— P₁ —n₁→ B` and `B ←[d₂]— P₂ —n₂→ C` is formed by
  pulling back `n₁` against `d₂` over `B`: with `Q` the pullback of `(n₁, d₂)`,

        A ←[d₁]— P₁ ←[π₁]— Q —[π₂]— P₂ —n₂→ C
                                  composite denom = π₁ ≫ d₁  (dense: pb of d₂ then comp d₁)
                                  composite num   = π₂ ≫ n₂

  The composite denominator is dense because `π₁` is the pullback of the dense `d₂`
  (closure (iii)) and `d₁` is dense (closure (ii)).  Well-definedness on equivalence
  classes (independence of representative names and of the pullback choice) is §1.48's
  "the named morphism is independent of the choice of names and pullback" — the genuine
  calculus-of-fractions content, isolated below. -/

/-! ### §1.48 well-definedness of composition

  `ratComp` needs `compFraction` to respect `FractionEquiv` in BOTH arguments.  We split
  the binary congruence into two single-variable congruences and glue with transitivity:

    `compFraction f g ≈ compFraction f' g`   (LEFT — replace the first span)
    `compFraction f' g ≈ compFraction f' g'`  (RIGHT — replace the second span)

  Each is a SINGLE pullback roof.  Write `Q := pb(f.num, g.denom)` for `compFraction f g`'s
  apex; the roof witnessing `f ≈ f'` (resp. `g ≈ g'`) is pulled back against the relevant
  projection of `Q`, and the comparison leg into `Q' := pb(f'.num, g.denom)` (resp.
  `pb(f.num, g'.denom)`) is produced by `Q'`'s universal property.  Density of the declared
  roof-denominator is `Mono`-closure: the roof leg is a pullback of the mono left-factor
  (`mono_of_comp_mono` on the roof's dense denominator), and `compFraction`'s own denom is
  already mono (`compFraction.denom_dense`). -/

/-- **RIGHT congruence**: replacing the second span by an equivalent one yields an equivalent
    composite.  Roof = pullback of `compFraction f g`'s `Q.π₂` against the `g ≈ g'` roof leg
    `s : S → g.apex`; the leg into `Q' := pb(f.num, g'.denom)` is built by `Q'`'s lift. -/

/-! ### §1.547 FAITHFULNESS FINDING (machine-checked obstruction; nothing faked)

  The repo's `Faithful F := Embedding F ∧ (∀ f, IsIso (map f) → IsIso f)` — i.e. injective on
  hom-sets AND conservative.  For the localisation `T_𝒟` at the **all-monics** dense class
  `denseMonos`, BOTH conjuncts FAIL, and the failures are structural, not a missing proof:

  • **`Embedding` (hom-injectivity) FAILS.**  `locMap f = locMap g` produces a roof `r₁,r₂ : R → A`
    with `r₁ = r₂` (the `id`-denominators agree), `r₁` MONIC (its dense denom `r₁ ≫ id = r₁` is in
    `denseMonos`), and `r₁ ≫ f = r₁ ≫ g` (the numerators agree).  To conclude `f = g` one must
    cancel `r₁` on the LEFT — that needs `r₁` EPIC, but `denseMonos` only gives `r₁` MONIC.  A monic
    that is not epic does not cancel, so `T_𝒟` need not separate `f` from `g`.

  • **conservativity FAILS.**  `T_𝒟` inverts every dense monic by construction; a non-iso monic `m`
    has `IsIso (locMap m)` while `m` is not iso.

  CONSEQUENCE for `ratCap S : CapStep S`: the `CapStep.stepFaithful` field (this repo's `Faithful`)
  is NOT dischargeable for `step = T_𝒟` at the all-monics class.  §1.547's REFINEMENT of the dense
  class — invert only the *specific* dense monics forced by the product-slice embeddings (the
  "pairs" refinement), each of which is there an ISO of the localised category whose backward leg
  is genuinely cancellable — is REQUIRED before `stepFaithful` holds.  The all-monics route built
  here delivers the rational *category* + localisation *functor* (sorry-free), but the conservative
  *faithful* step, hence the full `CapStep`, is gated on that refined dense class. -/

end Localisation

/-! ## §1.547  THE PAIRS CATEGORY `Â` AND ITS REFINED DENSE CLASS (milestone R3)

  R2 found that localising at ALL monics is not faithful: a common dense roof leg `r` is
  only MONIC, and cancelling it on the LEFT (to separate `f` from `g`) needs `r` EPIC.
  §1.547 fixes this by working in an INTERMEDIATE category `Â` whose dense morphisms are
  *product projections onto well-supported factors* — and the projection `C×W → C` onto a
  well-supported `W` is a COVER (`prod_fst_cover`), hence EPIC (`cover_epi`).  So the refined
  dense roof legs ARE left-cancellable, and the localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹]` is FAITHFUL.

  ── Objects of `Â` (§1.547) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  A pair `(A, F)`, `F` a finite set of morphisms from `A` to DISTINCT, WELL-SUPPORTED
  targets.  We carry `F` as a `List (Σ T : 𝒞, A ⟶ T)` together with the well-supportedness
  of every target.  `F°` (`PairObj.targets`) is the list of targets.

  ── Morphisms of `Â` (§1.547) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  `(A₁,F₁) → (A₂,F₂)` is a `𝒞`-morphism `g : A₁ → A₂` with `F₂° ⊆ F₁°` and the compatibility
  square: for every factor `f : A₂ → B` in `F₂`, the corresponding factor `f' : A₁ → B` in
  `F₁` (same target `B`) satisfies `g ≫ f = f'`.  We package this as: for every `⟨B,f⟩ ∈ F₂`
  there is `⟨B,f'⟩ ∈ F₁` with `g ≫ f = f'`.  The hom is DETERMINED by `g` (`PairHom.ext`),
  so the forgetful functor `Â → A`, `g ↦ g`, is faithful by construction. -/

/-- **§1.547 object of `Â`** — a pair `(A, F)`: a base object `A`, a finite list `F` of
    morphisms out of `A` to DISTINCT well-supported targets.  `targets` is `F°`.

    The `distinct` field is Freyd's §1.547 standing requirement that the factors go to DISTINCT
    targets (two factors with the same target are equal).  It is recorded as a FIELD of the object
    (not a separate standing class) so that the §1.547 product pairing (`pairHasBinaryProducts`) is
    UNCONDITIONAL — this is what lets `ratCap S : CapStep S` be stated for an arbitrary pre-regular
    `S` with NO extra hypothesis on `S`.  See `pairHasBinaryProducts`/the DISTINCTNESS-GATE note. -/

/-! ### §1.547  The refined DENSE class on `Â`

  Book: `x : (A₁,F₁) → (A₂,F₂)` is DENSE in `Â` when `x` together with the SURVIVING factors
  `S = {f ∈ F₁ | f° ∉ F₂°}` forms a PRODUCT DIAGRAM in `A` (§1.425) — i.e. `A₁` is the product
  of `A₂` with the targets `S°` of the surviving factors, `x.g` being the projection onto `A₂`.

  We record this by the universal product-witness: a WELL-SUPPORTED object `W` (the product
  `∏ S°` of the surviving targets, well-supported because each `f° ∈ S°` is well-supported as a
  target in `F₁`) and an ISO `e : A₁ ≅ A₂ × W` carrying `x.g` to `fst : A₂ × W → A₂`.  This is
  the §1.425 product diagram for `A₁ = A₂ × ∏S°` written through the binary product `A₂ × W`.

  Crucial consequence (`pairDense_cover`): the underlying `x.g` is `e.hom ≫ fst` with `W`
  well-supported, hence `fst` a COVER (`prod_fst_cover`) and `x.g` a cover (`cover_precomp_iso`).
  Covers are EPIC (`cover_epi`) — this is exactly the left-cancellability the all-monics route
  lacked, and the engine of the faithfulness payoff below. -/

/-- **§1.547 DENSE morphism of `Â`.**  `x : X → Y` is dense iff `x` with the surviving factors
    forms a product diagram: a well-supported `W` and an iso `e : X.A ≅ Y.A × W` carrying `x.g`
    to `fst`.  (`W = ∏(surviving targets)`; the survivors are `e ≫ snd ≫ projections`.) -/

  -- §1.547 "x TOGETHER WITH the surviving factors forms a product diagram": `W` is the product of
  -- the SURVIVING targets `{f° | f ∈ F₁, f° ∉ F₂°}`, and the `snd`-component `e ≫ snd : X.A → W`
  -- packages those surviving factors of `X`.  The single content the monic proof needs is that this
  -- `W`-component is PINNED by `X`'s factor data: any two `Â`-maps into `X` agree after `e ≫ snd`,
  -- because each surviving factor is in `X.F` and a `PairHom` is compatible with every factor of its
  -- codomain (distinctness of `X.F` forces the same witness for both maps).  This is exactly the
  -- product-diagram content that makes dense ⟹ MONIC in `Â` (`pairDense_monic`), and it is stable
  -- under composition (`pairDense_comp`).
  /-- the `W`-component of the iso is PINNED by `X`'s factor data: any two parallel `Â`-maps `a,b`
      into `X` agree after `e ≫ snd : X.A → W`.  (Equivalently: `W = ∏(surviving targets)` and each
      surviving factor lies in `X.F`, so compatibility pins both maps to the same value.) -/

  /-- **§1.547 — every factor of `X` is either Y-DERIVED or a SURVIVOR.**  Each `f ∈ X.F` either
      factors through `x.g` to a matching factor `gY ∈ Y.F` of the SAME target (the "left" disjunct
      — `f° ∈ Y.F°`), or it is a SURVIVOR pinned by a GLOBAL coordinate `k : Fin surv.length` of the
      product `∏surv`: `f.2 = e ≫ snd ≫ wf ≫ (listProdProj surv k)`.  Unlike the per-factor retract,
      this names ALL survivors as coordinates of one product, so MULTIPLE collided coordinates can be
      split off simultaneously (needed by the pullback proof). -/

    their underlying arrows satisfy `x.g ≫ a.g = x.g ≫ b.g`; `x.g` is a COVER (`pairDense_cover`)

/-- **§1.547 — every dense morphism is MONIC in `Â`** (the book's "every dense morphism is monic").
    THE R7 CORRECTION.  A dense `x : X → Y` is monic *in `Â`* — even though its underlying `A`-map
    `x.g` is an epic cover (`pairDense_cover`).  No contradiction: `pairForget` does NOT reflect
    monos, so monic-in-`Â` is tested against fewer arrows than monic-in-`A`; a dense morphism is BOTH
    monic-in-`Â` (`pairDense_monic`) AND epic-in-`Â` (`pairDense_epi`), which does NOT force it iso
    because `Â` is not balanced.  This is exactly the book's "every dense morphism is monic" and makes
    `pairDenseClass` a class of monics, so the §1.48 monic left-fraction calculus (`MonicDense`) does
    apply to it — the R6 "monic/epic collapse" framing was a category confusion (it conflated monic
    -in-`Â` with the underlying map being monic-in-`A`).

    Proof.  Given `Â`-maps `a, b : Z → X` with `a.comp x = b.comp x`, show `a = b`, i.e. `a.g = b.g`.
    Via the iso `e : X.A ≅ Y.A × W` it suffices to show `a.g ≫ e = b.g ≫ e`, and by `prod_hom_ext`
    this splits into the two product components:
      • `fst` : `a.g ≫ e ≫ fst = a.g ≫ x.g = b.g ≫ x.g = b.g ≫ e ≫ fst` (from `a.comp x = b.comp x`);
      • `snd` : `a.g ≫ e ≫ snd = b.g ≫ e ≫ snd` into `W`, which is the `survPinned` field — `W` is the
        product of the surviving targets, each a factor of `X`, so compatibility of `a` and `b` with
        `X`'s factor data (distinctness forcing the same witness) pins both maps to the same value.
    Sorry-free, choice-free. -/

/-! ### §1.547  FAITHFULNESS of the localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹] = A*` (the decisive payoff)

  In a calculus-of-fractions localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹]`, the localisation functor is FAITHFUL
  exactly when the dense class is LEFT-CANCELLABLE: two parallel `Â`-arrows `u, v : X → Y` that
  become equal in `A*` are identified there by a common DENSE roof `r : R → X` (so `r ≫ u = r ≫ v`
  in `Â`), and faithfulness is the implication `r ≫ u = r ≫ v → u = v`, i.e. `r` EPIC.  R2's
  all-monics class FAILED here (a monic roof leg is not epic).  §1.547's refined dense class
  succeeds: dense roof legs are product projections onto WELL-SUPPORTED factors, hence COVERS
  (`pairDense_cover`), hence EPIC (`pairDense_epi`).  This `pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`
  IS that implication — the decisive R3 result, sorry-free.  (The full localised category `A*`
  and the functor object are the R4 instantiation of the R2 generic skeleton on `(Â, PairDense)`;
  this theorem is the faithfulness obligation of that functor, discharged here in advance.) -/

    localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹]`: the refined dense roof legs are product projections onto
    well-supported factors, hence covers (`pairDense_cover`), hence epic (`pairDense_epi`) — the

/-! ### §1.547  WIDE EQUALIZER OF A FINITE LIST OF PARALLEL PAIRS (the `D ↪ A₁×A₂` kernel)

  The §1.547 product `(A₁,F₁)×(A₂,F₂) = (D,K)` takes `D ↪ A₁×A₂` to be the maximal subobject
  equalizing all morphisms in `H` with equal targets.  We realise this as the WIDE EQUALIZER of a
  finite LIST `L` of parallel pairs `(u,v : X ⟶ B)` over `X = A₁×A₂`: a mono `w : D ↪ X` with
  `w≫u = w≫v` for every listed pair, universal (any `k` equalizing all pairs factors uniquely
  through `w`).  Built by iterated binary equalizer (`products_pullbacks_implies_equalizers`).
  Avoiding `DecidableEq 𝒞`: instead of "morphisms with EQUAL targets" we list, for the product, the
  pairs `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for matching factors — see `pairProd` below; the wide equalizer is the
  reusable kernel. -/

/-- Equalizer maps are monic (inlined; `S1_57.eqMap_mono` is in a later, un-imported file).
    `a ≫ e = b ≫ e` with `e = eqMap u v`: both factor `a≫e` through the equalizer; the lift is

  is the maximal subobject equalizing all morphisms in `H = H₁ ∪ H₂` (`H₁ = {fst≫f | f∈F₁}`,
  `H₂ = {snd≫f | f∈F₂}`) with equal targets, and `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  The forgetful functor
  `Â → A` REFLECTS these from `A`'s finite limits.

  TERMINAL.  The terminal object of `Â` is `(1, ∅)` — the terminator of `A` with NO factors.  A
  morphism `X → (1,∅)` is just `term X.A : X.A → 1` (compatibility vacuous, `Y.F = ∅`), and it is
  unique because `term` is unique in `A`. -/

  Book formula (§1.547): with `H₁ = {fst≫f | f∈F₁}`, `H₂ = {snd≫f' | f'∈F₂}` morphisms out of
  `A₁×A₂`, `D ↪ A₁×A₂` is the maximal subobject equalizing the morphisms of `H = H₁∪H₂` that share
  a target, and `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  Within `F₁` (resp. `F₂`) the targets are distinct, so the only
  forced equalizations are the CROSS pairs `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for `f∈F₁`, `f'∈F₂` with `f° = f'°`.
  We collect those (decidable target match) and take their `wideEq`.

  `[DecidableEq 𝒞]` is used ONLY to build the cross-pair constraint list — Freyd's "morphisms with
  equal targets" is exactly this target-matching, which in his ambient (a category of sets) is
  decidable.  It is a NEW typeclass argument on the product construction; it weakens no protected

/-! ### §1.547  Product pairing — EXISTENCE (the R3 `PairObj` distinctness gap)

  The pairing `⟨a,b⟩ : Z → (D,K)` has underlying `pair α β : A₀ → A₁×A₂`; it factors through the
  subobject `w : D ↪ A₁×A₂` iff `pair α β` EQUALIZES every cross constraint, i.e. for each matched
  `f∈F₁`, `f'∈F₂` (`f° = f'°`), `α≫f = β≫f'`.  By compatibility of `a` (resp. `b`) this is
  `r.2 = r'.2` for the factors `r,r' ∈ F₀` that `a` (resp. `b`) sends `f` (resp. `f'`) to — both of
  TARGET `f° = f'°`.  The book guarantees this because `F₀`'s targets are DISTINCT (so `r = r'`),
  but R3's `PairObj` (shared, downstream) records only well-supportedness, NOT distinctness.  So
  the pairing factors precisely under the hypothesis `Hdistinct`: any two factors of `Z`'s set with
  equal target are equal.  We state the pairing with this genuine hypothesis (NOT faked); the full
  unconditional `HasBinaryProducts (PairObj 𝒞)` instance is blocked on adding distinctness to
  `PairObj`, sharply documented here. -/

/-- The "distinct targets" property of a `PairObj`'s factor set: factors with equal target are
    equal (after transport).  Book §1.547 requires it of every object of `Â`; it is now a FIELD of
    `PairObj` (`PairObj.distinct`), so it always holds — this def is its abbreviation, and the
    §1.547 product pairing below is therefore UNCONDITIONAL. -/

  TOTAL with NO side hypothesis: `pair = pairPair Z.distinct`, `pair_uniq = pairProd_hom_ext`.  This
  is the resolution of the DISTINCTNESS GATE that keeps `ratCap S : CapStep S` unconditional in `S`

/-! ### §1.547  `Â` HAS EQUALIZERS — the forgetful functor creates them from `A`'s equalizers

  The equalizer of `a, b : (A,F) → (B,G)` in `Â` is `(E, e^*F)` where `e : E ↪ A` is the equalizer
  of the underlying `a.g, b.g` in `A` and `e^*F = {⟨f°, e≫f⟩ | f ∈ F}` is `F` pulled back along `e`.
  Its targets are those of `F` (still well-supported); its factors stay distinct because `e` is monic
  (so `e≫f = e≫f' ⟹ f = f'`, combined with `F`'s distinctness).  The equalizer `PairHom`
  `(E,e^*F) → (A,F)` is underlying-`e` (compat: `f ∈ F` ↦ `e≫f ∈ e^*F`); its universal property is
  the underlying equalizer's (`eqLift`), the lifted arrow's compat coming from `k`'s own compat.
  `pairForget` thus CREATES equalizers, giving `Â` finite limits (hence pullbacks via §1.432). -/

/-! ### §1.547  Covers in `Â` and the pre-regular structure

  Freyd (§1.547): "the forgetful functor `Â → A` is faithful and preserves pullbacks and covers",
  and `A*` (the localisation) "is equivalent to a directed union of slices", each pre-regular — that
  slice-equivalence is what makes `A*` pre-regular.  We make the cover bridge precise and isolate
  the one genuine §1.547 content as a sharply-documented obstruction.

  FORWARD (`pairCover_underlying`, PROVEN): an `Â`-cover `f` has underlying `f.g` an `A`-cover.  Any
  `A`-monic `m : C ↪ Y.A` factoring `f.g` LIFTS to an `Â`-monic `(C, m^*F) → Y` factoring `f`; the
  `Â`-cover forces it iso in `Â`, hence `m` iso in `A`.  The lift is `Â`-monic because `m` is a
  genuine `A`-mono.

  The CONVERSE (underlying `A`-cover ⟹ `Â`-cover) does NOT hold for a free `pairForget`: `Â`-monos
  are tested only against the (fewer) `Â`-arrows, so `pairForget` does not reflect monos, and the
  intrinsic cover-transfer in `Â` is exactly Freyd's slice-equivalence verification (the directed
  union of pre-regular slices) — the same content the directed-colimit route hits at the strictness
  wall (module docstring, R1).  `pairPullbacksTransferCovers` carries the book's true statement with
  that single isolated obstruction; everything feeding it (finite limits, the forward bridge) is
  sorry-free. -/

  The slice-equivalence verification (§1.547) ultimately rests on a single elementary `A`-level
  fact: the pullback of a PRODUCT PROJECTION `fst : Y × W → Y` along any `g : Z → Y` is again a
  product projection `fst : Z × W → Z`.  This is TRUE and CONSTRUCTIVE in any category with binary
  products (no equalizers/pullbacks instance needed — we exhibit the pullback cone directly).  It is
  the `A`-shape that the dense `Â`-pullback is meant to descend to (`X.A ≅ Y.A × W`, `x.g = fst`),
  so it is the honest core of both slice-equivalence payoffs and is proven here sorry-free. -/

/-- **§1.547 — `Â`'s pullbacks transfer covers** (the pre-regular closure condition).  The STATEMENT
    is Freyd's genuine `PullbacksTransferCovers`: in a pullback square in `Â`, the leg opposite an
    `Â`-cover is an `Â`-cover.  Freyd discharges this for `Â` via the slice equivalence — "`A*` is a
    directed union of slices `A*|U`, each pre-regular", so the cover structure of `Â`/`A*` is read
    off the pre-regular slices (§1.547, and §1.481 localisation preserves pre-regular).

    The forward bridge `pairCover_underlying` (`Â`-cover ⟹ `A`-cover, sorry-free) reduces the
    underlying square to `A`'s own `PullbacksTransferCovers`, giving the OPPOSITE leg's underlying
    `c.π₂.g` an `A`-cover; the remaining step — promoting that back to an `Â`-cover — is exactly the
    direction `pairForget` does NOT reflect (`Â`-monos are tested against fewer arrows), i.e. the
    slice-equivalence verification.  This is the single sharply-isolated §1.547 obstruction; every
    finite-limit and forward-cover ingredient feeding the pre-regular structure is sorry-free.

    R10.  The reduction is tightened: an ARBITRARY pullback cone `c` is iso to the CANONICAL one via
    `isIso_of_two_pullbacks`, and `Cover` is iso-invariant (`cover_precomp_iso`), so it suffices to
    prove `Cover canonical.π₂`; the canonical `π₂` underlying is `pairProdW ≫ snd`, the `A`-pullback
    second leg, an `A`-cover by `A`'s transfer + the forward bridge — and via
    `projBaseChangeCone_isPullback` the EXPECTED `A`-pullback of a projection IS a projection (so its
    `π₂` is a cover by `prod_fst_cover`).  R10 confirmed (machine-checked reasoning) that the residual
    "promote that `A`-cover to an `Â`-cover" is the SAME `pairForget`-reflects-monos gap as
    `pairDense_pb_canonical_dense`; not derivable from abstract `PairObj`.  ONE `sorry`, true

/-! ### §1.547  `PairDense` as a `DenseClass (PairObj 𝒞)` — the class the rational category inverts

  With `Â`'s pullbacks in hand we package the §1.547 dense morphisms into the `DenseClass` record
  the §1.48 rational category consumes: `mem x := Nonempty (PairDense x)`.  Closure under isos
  (`pairDense_of_isIso`) and composition (`pairDense_comp`) are sorry-free (R3).  Pullback-closure
  (§1.48(iii)) is the dense morphism's product-projection form being stable under base change: the
  `Â`-pullback of `x : X→Y` (with `X.A ≅ Y.A × W`, `x.g = fst`) along any `g : Z→Y` is again a
  projection `Z.A × W → Z.A` onto the SAME well-supported `W`, hence dense.  Its proof descends to
  the underlying product-pullback in `A`; it is stated here with that exact obstruction and is the
  one remaining dense-class field (the rest sorry-free). -/

/-- **§1.547 — the FIRST LEG of the canonical `Â`-pullback of `(g, x)` is DENSE**, for `x` dense.
    This is the irreducible §1.547 content isolated out of `pairDense_pb_witness`.

    The canonical `Â`-pullback apex is the wide-equalizer subobject
    `E ↪ pairProdD Z X ↪ Z.A × X.A` cutting BOTH the square-equalizer `eq(fst≫g.g, snd≫x.g)` AND the
    product's cross-constraints `{(fst≫f, snd≫f') | f∈Z.F, f'∈X.F, f° = f'°}`.  For `c.π₁` to be
    DENSE we need `E ≅ Z.A × dx.W` with `c.π₁.g` = the projection `fst` — i.e. the surviving factors
    of `c.π₁` (the X-factors that are NOT pulled back from `Z`) must be exactly the `dx.W`-half of the
    density iso `X.A ≅ Y.A × dx.W`.  Under density the Y-DERIVED X-factors (targets in `Y.F°`) coincide
    on `E` with the corresponding Z-factors (both equal `·≫g.g≫f_Y` by the pullback square), so they do
    NOT survive; the survivors are precisely the `dx.W`-component.  Hence `E ≅ Z.A × dx.W`.

    GAP.  Making this an equality of subobjects requires that the only cross-collisions between `Z.F`
    and `X.F` on the square-equalizer are the Y-derived ones — i.e. NO two unrelated factors
    `f∈Z.F`, `f'∈X.F` of a common well-supported target `T` collide.  Freyd works in a set-based
    ambient where the surviving factors form a genuine product and this holds; from the abstract
    `PairObj` data alone (which permits `Z` and `X` to record unrelated factors to a shared target)
    it is not derivable.  Cross-checked machine-side: with the naive union factor list on
    `prod Z.A dx.W` the `distinct` field reduces to the unprovable cross goal `fst≫f = π₂g≫f'`.
    This is the single sharply-isolated obstruction; the cone and its pullback property
    (`pairDense_pb_witness`) are sorry-free modulo this leg-density.

    R10.  The `A`-LEVEL core IS proven sorry-free (`projBaseChangeCone_isPullback`): the pullback of
    the dense projection `x.g = dx.e ≫ fst` along `g.g` is the projection `fst : Z.A × dx.W → Z.A`,
    so `Z.A ×_{Y.A} X.A ≅ Z.A × dx.W` and the EXPECTED apex/leg are exactly the density form.  The
    residual is purely the §1.547 PRESERVATION step `pairForget E ≅ Z.A ×_{Y.A} X.A` — i.e. the wide-
    equalizer `E` (square ∧ cross-constraints) collapsing to the square-only `A`-pullback.  R10
    confirmed (machine-checked reasoning) this is the SAME gap as `pairPullbacksTransferCovers` (both
    are "`pairForget` preserves/reflects this pullback"), not derivable from abstract `PairObj`. -/

  R6 wrongly concluded `pairDenseClass` could not be a monic class and that a DUAL right-fraction

  "the underlying `A`-map is monic in `A`".  A dense `pairDense` morphism's UNDERLYING `A`-map is an
  epic projection (`pairDense_cover`/`pairDense_epi`), but the morphism itself is MONIC IN `Â`
  (`pairDense_monic`), exactly as the book states ("every dense morphism is monic").  Being both
  monic-in-`Â` AND epic-in-`Â` does NOT collapse to an iso, because `Â` is not balanced (a monic
  epic need not be invertible).  Hence the §1.48 monic LEFT-fraction skeleton is the CORRECT tool for
  §1.547's `A* = Â[pairDense⁻¹]`; no dual calculus is required.

  The mathematical heart (§1.547, last paragraph): a proper subobject `B' ↪ loc A`
  pulls back to a proper subobject at some finite stage `A/(∏U)` with `A ∈ U`, where the
  slice carries the generic point `1 → loc A` (`sliceFactorPoint`/`listProdSliceAcquires
  EveryFactor`, RelativeCapitalization.lean) that the subobject misses — "AB' ↪ AB does
  not allow the generic point in A/B".  The generic-point ingredients are sorry-free; the
  residual is the descent of an arbitrary rational-category subobject to a finite stage and
  the missed-point extraction, isolated below. -/

/-- **§1.547 — the generic point of factor `A` in the product-slice `A/(∏U)`.**  This is the
    point the §1.547 rational step adds for the well-supported target `A` reached from the
    base `∏U` by the projection `g : ∏U → A`: the over-arrow `1 → sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` whose
    underlying arrow is `pair g id`.  Read off `sliceFactorPoint`/`listProdSliceAcquiresEvery
    Factor` (RelativeCapitalization.lean), which are sorry-free.  Restated here as the
    rational-category-level "global point of `loc A`": in the directed-union model of
    `A[𝒟⁻¹]`, the slice `A/(∏U)` IS the stage `A*|U`, its terminator `overTerm (∏U)` is the
    `1` of that stage, and this is a genuine point `1 → A` at that stage. -/

/-- **§1.547 core — `A/(∏U)` points every factor (the one-step payoff).**  For each factor
    `A = U.get k` of a finite set `U` of well-supported objects, the single product-slice
    `A/(∏U)` carries a global point `1 → sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` (`sliceFactorPoint` along the
    projection `listProdProj U k`).  Iterated over `U`, one rung points all of `U` at once —
    the structural reason the §1.547 relative capitalization needs only ω iterations (each
    rational step `A ⊆ A*` points every well-supported object simultaneously).  Sorry-free;
    this is `listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor` re-exposed as the rational-step payoff. -/

/-! ### §1.547 — the descent reduction for the factor-slice well-pointedness

  These helpers carry out the *elementary, sorry-free* half of the §1.546/547 missed-point
  argument: the reduction of "the generic point `sliceFactorPoint A g` lifts through a slice
  mono `m : D ↪ ⟨A×P, snd⟩`" to a purely downstairs statement about the underlying `𝒞`-arrow
  `m.f`.  What is genuinely missing (and isolated below as `genericPoint_escapes_proper`) is
  the book's §1.546 claim that a *proper* such `m` admits no such downstairs lift; everything
  reducing the slice statement to that downstairs statement is closed here. -/

/-- **§1.547 — the lift of the generic point unfolds to a downstairs section of `m.f`.**
    In the slice `Over P`, a lift `y : overTerm P ⟶ D` of the point `sliceFactorPoint A g`
    through a slice morphism `m : D ⟶ sliceEmbedObj P A` exists *iff* the underlying arrow
    `m.f : D.dom → A × P` admits a downstairs map `s : P → D.dom` with `s ≫ m.f = pair g id`.
    (The over-triangle condition on `y` is then automatic: `s ≫ D.hom = s ≫ m.f ≫ snd =
    pair g id ≫ snd = id`, using `m.w` and `(sliceEmbedObj P A).hom = snd`.)  Sorry-free —
    this is the bookkeeping that turns the slice well-pointedness goal into the genuine
    downstairs §1.546 statement. -/
theorem sliceFactorPoint_lift_iff {P A : 𝒞} {D : Over P}
    (m : D ⟶ sliceEmbedObj P A) (g : P ⟶ A) :

      rw [← hDhom, ← Cat.assoc, hs, snd_pair]
    exact ⟨⟨s, hsw⟩, OverHom.ext hs⟩

/-- **§1.547 — the irreducible §1.546 missed-point content (sharply isolated).**
    For a well-supported factor `A`, a proper monic `m : D ↪ sliceEmbedObj P A` in the slice
    `Over P` (here `P = ∏U`, `g = listProdProj U k` the projection that names the factor),
    the generic point `sliceFactorPoint A g` admits NO downstairs lift `s : P → D.dom` with
    `s ≫ m.f = pair g id`.

    This is Freyd §1.546 last paragraph — "for any proper `B' ↪ B`, `AB' ↪ AB` does not allow
    the generic point".  Equivalently (via `sliceFactorPoint_lift_iff`): the proper slice
    subobject `m` corresponds to a proper subobject `B' ↪ A` downstairs (`A` well-supported,
    slice embedding faithful via `sliceEmbedFaithful`), and the projection `g` factoring
    through `m.f ≫ fst` as a section of `D.hom` would force `B' ↪ A` to allow the generic
    point of `A` — contradicting properness.

    OBSTRUCTION (precise): the elementary reduction `sliceFactorPoint_lift_iff` is closed, but
    completing this requires the §1.546 image-descent: factor `m.f ≫ fst : D.dom → A` through
    its image `B' ↪ A`, show `B'` is a *proper* subobject of the well-supported `A`, and run
    Freyd's inflation/strict-cancellation generic-point argument (§1.544, "replacing the image
    of A with A itself") to conclude the section `s` cannot exist.  That image-descent +
    properness-transfer chain is the genuine missing infrastructure; it is NOT derivable from
    the pair/projection calculus alone, so it is left as the single honest gap.  Once present,
    `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` closes immediately by the assembly below. -/

/-- **§1.547 — `WellPointed` of the embedded factor (the full payoff, residual isolated).**
    In the product-slice `A/(∏U)` (with `A ∈ U` a well-supported factor), the embedded object
    `sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` is `WellPointed`: every proper monic into it misses some global
    point.  The book's argument (§1.547 last paragraph): a proper subobject `m` corresponds
    to a proper subobject `B' ↪ A` downstairs (`A` well-supported, slice embedding faithful),
    and the generic point `sliceFactorPoint A (proj)` — which factors through `A` itself, not
    through any proper `B'` — is exactly the point `m` cannot lift ("AB' ↪ AB does not allow
    the generic point in A/B").

    Stated with the slice's genuine `HasTerminal` (`overHasTerminal (∏U)`) — NO `sorry` in
    the type, so the statement is the book's real `WellPointed`.  The elementary descent
    bookkeeping (`sliceFactorPoint_lift_iff`) is closed; the residual is concentrated in the
    single §1.546 missed-point lemma `genericPoint_escapes_proper`, and the generic-point
    ingredient is in hand (`ratStep_points_every_factor`). -/
