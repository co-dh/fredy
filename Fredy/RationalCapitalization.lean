  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §1.48 / §1.547
  THE RATIONAL CATEGORY `A[𝒟⁻¹]` AS A CALCULUS-OF-FRACTIONS CATEGORY,
  and the CHOICE-FREE relative capitalization `A ⊆ A*` of §1.547.

  ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (milestone R1) ────────────────────────────────────────

  The transfinite §1.546 capitalization (`CapitalizationTransfinite.lean`) and the
  ω-tower §1.544/§1.545 successor (`Capitalization.lean`, `RelativeCapitalization.lean`)
  both model `A*` as a *directed colimit of slice categories* — a `Colim.CatSystem`.
  That framework demands the directed transitions be **strictly** functorial
  (`CatSystem.F_refl : F (refl) X = X` and `F_trans` on the nose, CatColimit.lean:33).
  The §1.547 transition `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` for `V ⊆ U` is BASE-CHANGE (the pullback that
  grows the embedding domain `B×∏V ↝ B×∏U`); base-change is only *pseudo*-functorial,
  so `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` are FALSE for it (machine-checked, documented at
  `RelativeCapitalization.lean` `StrictBaseChange`/ROUTE-1).  Hence the slice-colimit
  model of `A*` hits a strictness wall, NOT sidestepped by §1.547.

  This file takes the OTHER route the book actually uses (§1.48, and which §1.547 cites):
  build the rational category `A[𝒟⁻¹]` **directly** as a calculus-of-fractions category —
  same objects as `A`; a morphism `A → B` is an equivalence class of spans
  `A ←[denom ∈ 𝒟]— • —num→ B`; composition by pullback.  There is NO directed colimit
  and hence NO transition-strictness obligation: the rational category is a *single*
  `Cat` built by quotienting each hom-set.  This is exactly why §1.547 phrases the
  inter-slice transitions as equivalences (up-to-iso) yet still gets a genuine category.

  ── WHAT THIS FILE DELIVERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The §1.48 scaffolding (`DenseClass`/`Fraction`/`FractionEquiv`/`RationalCategory`)
  already lives in `S1_47.lean` as DEFINITIONS + a universal-property record, but the
  actual category (composition by pullback, well-definedness, the `Cat` instance) was
  never built.  Here:

    * `denseMonos 𝒞`          — SORRY-FREE (`propext` only).  The dense class of ALL
                                monics (closed under iso/comp/pb; §1.48(i)-(iii) from
                                `mono_pullback`).  The working dense class for `A[𝒟⁻¹]`.
    * `FractionEquiv` EQUIVALENCE RELATION — SORRY-FREE over `denseMonos 𝒞`.  Reflexivity,
                                symmetry, AND transitivity all proven; transitivity closes
                                via the pullback-roof whose dense leg is monic because
                                `r₁`,`s₂` are mono left-factors and pullbacks of monics are
                                monic (`mono_of_comp_mono`/`mono_pullback`/`mono_comp'`).
    * `RatHom A B`/`ratId`/`locMap` — SORRY-FREE (`propext`).  `Quotient (fractionSetoid …)`,
                                the hom-set of `A[𝒟⁻¹]`; identity span; localisation of an
                                ordinary arrow.
    * `compFraction`         — SORRY-FREE.  The composite span by pullback of `(num₁,denom₂)`,
                                with its denominator dense by pb+comp closure.
    * `ratComp`              — SORRY-FREE (milestone R2).  Composition on equivalence classes;
                                the `Quotient.lift₂` WELL-DEFINEDNESS (independence of names +
                                pullback choice, §1.48) is discharged by the two single-span
                                congruences `compFraction_congr_left`/`_right` (each a single
                                pullback roof) glued by `fractionEquiv_trans`.  Axioms: `propext`,
                                `Quot.sound`.
    * `compFraction_idFraction_left/right`, `compFraction_assoc` — SORRY-FREE (R2).  Unit and
                                associativity laws of `compFraction` up to `FractionEquiv`.
    * `Rat 𝒞` / `ratCat`     — SORRY-FREE (R2).  The rational category `A[denseMonos⁻¹]` as a
                                genuine `Cat` (objects = a structure wrapper of `𝒞`'s objects so
                                its `Cat` instance does not collapse onto `𝒞`'s; homs = `RatHom`;
                                comp = `ratComp`; the three laws lifted from `compFraction`).
    * `locFunctor`           — SORRY-FREE (R2).  The localisation functor `T_𝒟 : 𝒞 → A[denseMonos⁻¹]`
                                (identity on objects, `f ↦ locMap f`); `map_id` definitional,
                                `map_comp` via `locMap_comp_equiv` (pullback-against-identity roof).
    * FAITHFULNESS FINDING (R2, machine-checked) — at the ALL-MONICS class, `T_𝒟` is NEITHER an
                                `Embedding` (left-cancelling a dense MONIC roof leg would need it
                                EPIC) NOR conservative (it inverts every monic).  So the repo's
                                `Faithful` — hence `CapStep.stepFaithful`, hence a genuine
                                `ratCap S : CapStep S` with `step = T_𝒟` — is GATED on §1.547's
                                dense-class refinement (invert only the slice-embedding monics).
                                No `ratCap` is asserted here: doing so at this class would require
                                faking `stepFaithful`, which the integrity rules forbid.  See the
                                "§1.547 FAITHFULNESS FINDING" block at the localisation section.
    * Cartesian / pre-regular `PreRegularCategory (Rat 𝒞)` — NOT built in R2.  Transporting
                                finite limits + covers through `T_𝒟` is a large separate effort
                                and, per the faithfulness finding, would still not yield `ratCap`
                                without the refined class; left for R3 rather than stubbed.
    * `ratStep_points_every_factor` / `slice_factor_point_acquired` — SORRY-FREE.  The §1.547
                                per-step PAYOFF: the product-slice `A/(∏U)` carries a global
                                point of every factor (re-exposed `listProdSliceAcquiresEvery
                                Factor`).
    * `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` — the §1.547 well-pointedness CORE, stated with the
                                slice's genuine `HasTerminal` (overHasTerminal) — NO sorry in
                                the type, so it is the book's real `WellPointed`.  The descent
                                of an arbitrary subobject to the downstairs proper `B'` and the
                                missed-point extraction is the isolated `sorry`.

  ── MILESTONE R3 (§1.547 pairs category + refined dense class + FAITHFULNESS) ──────

    * `PairObj`/`PairHom`/`pairsCat` — the §1.547 INTERMEDIATE category `Â`: objects `(A,F)` with
                                `F` a finite set of morphisms to well-supported targets; morphisms
                                `g : A₁→A₂` with `F₂° ⊆ F₁°` and the compatibility square.  A
                                genuine `Cat`, SORRY-FREE, NO axioms (homs determined by `g`).
    * `pairForget`/`pairForget_embedding` — the forgetful `Â → A` is a functor and an `Embedding`
                                (faithful by `PairHom.ext`).  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.
    * `PairDense` — the §1.547 REFINED dense class: `x` is dense iff it + the surviving factors
                                form a PRODUCT DIAGRAM (witnessed by `X.A ≅ Y.A × W`, `W` the
                                well-supported product of surviving targets, `x.g = fst`).
    * `pairDense_cover` — every dense morphism's underlying arrow is a COVER (`fst` onto a
                                well-supported factor; `prod_fst_cover`+`cover_precomp_iso`).
                                SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.  This is the cancellability R2 lacked.
    * `pairDense_of_iso`/`pairDense_of_isIso` (isos dense) and `pairDense_comp` (dense closed
                                under composition, surviving object `W_y × Wₓ`) — the dense-class
                                closure laws.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms (choice-free).
    * `pairDense_epi` / **`pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`** — THE DECISIVE R3 RESULT:
                                dense morphisms are EPIC in `Â` (their underlying cover is epic,
                                `cover_epi`), so two parallel `Â`-arrows identified by a common
                                DENSE roof are equal — this IS the FAITHFULNESS of the §1.547
                                localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹] = A*`.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms,
                                choice-free.  R2's all-monics route FAILED exactly here (a monic
                                roof leg is not epic); §1.547's product-projection dense legs are
                                covers, hence epic — faithfulness re-established.

  ── MILESTONE R4 (§1.547 `Â` IS CARTESIAN — terminal + binary products, sorry-free) ──────────────

    * `WideEq`/`wideEqNil`/`wideEqCons`/`wideEq` — the reusable WIDE EQUALIZER of a finite LIST of
                                parallel pairs over `X`: the maximal subobject `w : D ↪ X`
                                equalizing all listed pairs, universal.  Built by iterated binary
                                equalizer (`products_pullbacks_implies_equalizers`).  This is the
                                `D ↪ A₁×A₂` kernel of Freyd's §1.547 product formula.  SORRY-FREE,
                                choice-free (`propext`,`Quot.sound`).
    * `pairHasTerminal` — `Â` HAS A TERMINAL OBJECT `(1,∅)` (terminator of `A`, no factors); the
                                unique arrow is `term`, unique by `term_uniq`.  SORRY-FREE, NO axioms.
    * `crossConstraints`/`pairProdD`/`pairProdW`/`pairProdK`/`pairProdObj` — the §1.547 PRODUCT
                                OBJECT `(A₁,F₁)×(A₂,F₂) = (D,K)`: `D = wideEq` of the cross
                                constraints `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for matched factors `f∈F₁`,`f'∈F₂`
                                (`f°=f'°`, decided by `DecidableEq 𝒞` = Freyd's "equal targets"),
                                `w : D ↪ A₁×A₂`, `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  Projections `pairProjFst/Snd`.
                                SORRY-FREE, choice-free.
    * `pairProd_hom_ext` — UNIQUENESS of the product pairing (unconditional): agreement after both
                                projections + `w` monic + `prod_hom_ext` ⟹ equality.  SORRY-FREE.
    * `pairPair`/`pairPair_fst`/`pairPair_snd`/`pairProd_lift` — EXISTENCE of the pairing (data,
                                choice-free) under the book's target-distinctness `Z.DistinctTargets`.
    * `PairTargetsDistinct` + `pairHasBinaryProducts` — `Â` HAS BINARY PRODUCTS, under the book's
                                STANDING ASSUMPTION (`PairTargetsDistinct 𝒞`: every object of `Â`
                                has factors to DISTINCT targets — Freyd builds this into objects of
                                `Â`; R3's `PairObj` recorded only well-supportedness, so it is made
                                an explicit class here, NOT a weakening).  SORRY-FREE, choice-free.

  THE DISTINCTNESS GATE (machine-checked, nothing faked).  Freyd's §1.547 objects of `Â` have
  factors to DISTINCT well-supported targets; R3's `PairObj` (shared, downstream — not editable
  here) dropped distinctness.  The product OBJECT/PROJECTIONS/UNIQUENESS are unconditional, but the
  pairing EXISTENCE (`pairProd_lift`) genuinely needs `Z.DistinctTargets` (two factors of `Z` to one
  target may differ otherwise).  So `HasBinaryProducts (PairObj 𝒞)` is GATED on the explicit class
  `PairTargetsDistinct 𝒞`.  This is the sharply-located obstruction; nothing is stubbed.

  Still R4/R5 (not faked here): `HasPullbacks (PairObj 𝒞)` (binary products + the §1.547 equalizers,
  same gate); `PreRegularCategory (PairObj 𝒞)`; `DenseClass (PairObj 𝒞)` + dense pullback-closure;
  the R2 generic skeleton instantiation on `(Â, PairDense)` to get `A* = Â[PairDense⁻¹]` + functor;
  and `ratCap S : CapStep S`.  The faithfulness OBLIGATION of that functor is already discharged by
  `pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`.  No `ratCap` is asserted (its `stepFaithful` field is
  exactly this criterion; the remaining `CapStep` preservation fields are the further instantiation).

  ── INTEGRITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  No `axiom`, no `: True`, no `sorry` on a false statement, no `sorry` in any STATEMENT/type.
  The SINGLE remaining `sorry` is the R2 residual `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` (the §1.547
  subobject-descent); its STATEMENT is the book's genuine `WellPointed`, sharply documented as a
  precisely-located obstruction.  The protected types of `capData_exists`/`CapData`/`CapStep` are
  not touched by this file.  No fake `ratCap` is asserted.

/-! ## §1.48  The dense class of ALL monics

  Freyd's §1.48 dense class needs only (i) all isos, (ii) closure under composition,
  (iii) closure under pullback.  The class of *all* monics satisfies these: isos are
  monic, monics compose, and the pullback of a monic is monic (`mono_pullback`,
  S1_45.lean).  §1.547's "dense monics" are a *sub*-class of this (the dense morphisms
  `x` that, with the surviving factors, form a product diagram); for the rational
  category as a localisation we may take the largest dense class that still inverts what
  we need — and the all-monics class is the cleanest concrete instance, sorry-free. -/

  Two fraction spans name the same morphism of `A[𝒟⁻¹]` iff they share a common

  is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive — so the hom-set is a genuine `Quotient`.
  Reflexivity: the identity roof (`id ∈ 𝒟`).  Symmetry: swap the roof legs.
  Transitivity: the pullback of the two roofs, glued over the shared apex; the composite
  denominator stays in `𝒟` by the dense class's composition + pullback closure. -/

/-! ## §1.48  Composition by pullback

  The composite of spans `A ←[d₁]— P₁ —n₁→ B` and `B ←[d₂]— P₂ —n₂→ C` is formed by
  pulling back `n₁` against `d₂` over `B`: with `Q` the pullback of `(n₁, d₂)`,

        A ←[d₁]— P₁ ←[π₁]— Q —[π₂]— P₂ —n₂→ C
                                  composite denom = π₁ ≫ d₁  (dense: pb of d₂ then comp d₁)
                                  composite num   = π₂ ≫ n₂

  The composite denominator is dense because `π₁` is the pullback of the dense `d₂`
  (closure (iii)) and `d₁` is dense (closure (ii)).  Well-definedness on equivalence
  classes (independence of representative names and of the pullback choice) is §1.48's
  "the named morphism is independent of the choice of names and pullback" — the genuine
  calculus-of-fractions content, isolated below. -/

/-! ### §1.48 well-definedness of composition

  `ratComp` needs `compFraction` to respect `FractionEquiv` in BOTH arguments.  We split
  the binary congruence into two single-variable congruences and glue with transitivity:

    `compFraction f g ≈ compFraction f' g`   (LEFT — replace the first span)
    `compFraction f' g ≈ compFraction f' g'`  (RIGHT — replace the second span)

  Each is a SINGLE pullback roof.  Write `Q := pb(f.num, g.denom)` for `compFraction f g`'s
  apex; the roof witnessing `f ≈ f'` (resp. `g ≈ g'`) is pulled back against the relevant
  projection of `Q`, and the comparison leg into `Q' := pb(f'.num, g.denom)` (resp.
  `pb(f.num, g'.denom)`) is produced by `Q'`'s universal property.  Density of the declared
  roof-denominator is `Mono`-closure: the roof leg is a pullback of the mono left-factor
  (`mono_of_comp_mono` on the roof's dense denominator), and `compFraction`'s own denom is
  already mono (`compFraction.denom_dense`). -/

/-- **RIGHT congruence**: replacing the second span by an equivalent one yields an equivalent
    composite.  Roof = pullback of `compFraction f g`'s `Q.π₂` against the `g ≈ g'` roof leg
    `s : S → g.apex`; the leg into `Q' := pb(f.num, g'.denom)` is built by `Q'`'s lift. -/

/-! ### §1.547 FAITHFULNESS FINDING (machine-checked obstruction; nothing faked)

  The repo's `Faithful F := Embedding F ∧ (∀ f, IsIso (map f) → IsIso f)` — i.e. injective on
  hom-sets AND conservative.  For the localisation `T_𝒟` at the **all-monics** dense class
  `denseMonos`, BOTH conjuncts FAIL, and the failures are structural, not a missing proof:

  • **`Embedding` (hom-injectivity) FAILS.**  `locMap f = locMap g` produces a roof `r₁,r₂ : R → A`
    with `r₁ = r₂` (the `id`-denominators agree), `r₁` MONIC (its dense denom `r₁ ≫ id = r₁` is in
    `denseMonos`), and `r₁ ≫ f = r₁ ≫ g` (the numerators agree).  To conclude `f = g` one must
    cancel `r₁` on the LEFT — that needs `r₁` EPIC, but `denseMonos` only gives `r₁` MONIC.  A monic
    that is not epic does not cancel, so `T_𝒟` need not separate `f` from `g`.

  • **conservativity FAILS.**  `T_𝒟` inverts every dense monic by construction; a non-iso monic `m`
    has `IsIso (locMap m)` while `m` is not iso.

  CONSEQUENCE for `ratCap S : CapStep S`: the `CapStep.stepFaithful` field (this repo's `Faithful`)
  is NOT dischargeable for `step = T_𝒟` at the all-monics class.  §1.547's REFINEMENT of the dense
  class — invert only the *specific* dense monics forced by the product-slice embeddings (the
  "pairs" refinement), each of which is there an ISO of the localised category whose backward leg
  is genuinely cancellable — is REQUIRED before `stepFaithful` holds.  The all-monics route built
  here delivers the rational *category* + localisation *functor* (sorry-free), but the conservative
  *faithful* step, hence the full `CapStep`, is gated on that refined dense class. -/

end Localisation

/-! ## §1.547  THE PAIRS CATEGORY `Â` AND ITS REFINED DENSE CLASS (milestone R3)

  R2 found that localising at ALL monics is not faithful: a common dense roof leg `r` is
  only MONIC, and cancelling it on the LEFT (to separate `f` from `g`) needs `r` EPIC.
  §1.547 fixes this by working in an INTERMEDIATE category `Â` whose dense morphisms are
  *product projections onto well-supported factors* — and the projection `C×W → C` onto a
  well-supported `W` is a COVER (`prod_fst_cover`), hence EPIC (`cover_epi`).  So the refined
  dense roof legs ARE left-cancellable, and the localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹]` is FAITHFUL.

  ── Objects of `Â` (§1.547) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  A pair `(A, F)`, `F` a finite set of morphisms from `A` to DISTINCT, WELL-SUPPORTED
  targets.  We carry `F` as a `List (Σ T : 𝒞, A ⟶ T)` together with the well-supportedness
  of every target.  `F°` (`PairObj.targets`) is the list of targets.

  ── Morphisms of `Â` (§1.547) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  `(A₁,F₁) → (A₂,F₂)` is a `𝒞`-morphism `g : A₁ → A₂` with `F₂° ⊆ F₁°` and the compatibility
  square: for every factor `f : A₂ → B` in `F₂`, the corresponding factor `f' : A₁ → B` in
  `F₁` (same target `B`) satisfies `g ≫ f = f'`.  We package this as: for every `⟨B,f⟩ ∈ F₂`
  there is `⟨B,f'⟩ ∈ F₁` with `g ≫ f = f'`.  The hom is DETERMINED by `g` (`PairHom.ext`),
  so the forgetful functor `Â → A`, `g ↦ g`, is faithful by construction. -/

/-! ### §1.547  The refined DENSE class on `Â`

  Book: `x : (A₁,F₁) → (A₂,F₂)` is DENSE in `Â` when `x` together with the SURVIVING factors
  `S = {f ∈ F₁ | f° ∉ F₂°}` forms a PRODUCT DIAGRAM in `A` (§1.425) — i.e. `A₁` is the product
  of `A₂` with the targets `S°` of the surviving factors, `x.g` being the projection onto `A₂`.

  We record this by the universal product-witness: a WELL-SUPPORTED object `W` (the product
  `∏ S°` of the surviving targets, well-supported because each `f° ∈ S°` is well-supported as a
  target in `F₁`) and an ISO `e : A₁ ≅ A₂ × W` carrying `x.g` to `fst : A₂ × W → A₂`.  This is
  the §1.425 product diagram for `A₁ = A₂ × ∏S°` written through the binary product `A₂ × W`.

  Crucial consequence (`pairDense_cover`): the underlying `x.g` is `e.hom ≫ fst` with `W`
  well-supported, hence `fst` a COVER (`prod_fst_cover`) and `x.g` a cover (`cover_precomp_iso`).
  Covers are EPIC (`cover_epi`) — this is exactly the left-cancellability the all-monics route
  lacked, and the engine of the faithfulness payoff below. -/

/-! ### §1.547  FAITHFULNESS of the localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹] = A*` (the decisive payoff)

  In a calculus-of-fractions localisation `Â → Â[dense⁻¹]`, the localisation functor is FAITHFUL
  exactly when the dense class is LEFT-CANCELLABLE: two parallel `Â`-arrows `u, v : X → Y` that
  become equal in `A*` are identified there by a common DENSE roof `r : R → X` (so `r ≫ u = r ≫ v`
  in `Â`), and faithfulness is the implication `r ≫ u = r ≫ v → u = v`, i.e. `r` EPIC.  R2's
  all-monics class FAILED here (a monic roof leg is not epic).  §1.547's refined dense class
  succeeds: dense roof legs are product projections onto WELL-SUPPORTED factors, hence COVERS
  (`pairDense_cover`), hence EPIC (`pairDense_epi`).  This `pairLocalisation_faithful_criterion`
  IS that implication — the decisive R3 result, sorry-free.  (The full localised category `A*`
  and the functor object are the R4 instantiation of the R2 generic skeleton on `(Â, PairDense)`;
  this theorem is the faithfulness obligation of that functor, discharged here in advance.) -/

  The §1.547 product `(A₁,F₁)×(A₂,F₂) = (D,K)` takes `D ↪ A₁×A₂` to be the maximal subobject
  equalizing all morphisms in `H` with equal targets.  We realise this as the WIDE EQUALIZER of a
  finite LIST `L` of parallel pairs `(u,v : X ⟶ B)` over `X = A₁×A₂`: a mono `w : D ↪ X` with
  `w≫u = w≫v` for every listed pair, universal (any `k` equalizing all pairs factors uniquely
  through `w`).  Built by iterated binary equalizer (`products_pullbacks_implies_equalizers`).
  Avoiding `DecidableEq 𝒞`: instead of "morphisms with EQUAL targets" we list, for the product, the
  pairs `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for matching factors — see `pairProd` below; the wide equalizer is the
  reusable kernel. -/

  `H₂ = {snd≫f | f∈F₂}`) with equal targets, and `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  The forgetful functor
  `Â → A` REFLECTS these from `A`'s finite limits.

  TERMINAL.  The terminal object of `Â` is `(1, ∅)` — the terminator of `A` with NO factors.  A
  morphism `X → (1,∅)` is just `term X.A : X.A → 1` (compatibility vacuous, `Y.F = ∅`), and it is
  unique because `term` is unique in `A`. -/

  Book formula (§1.547): with `H₁ = {fst≫f | f∈F₁}`, `H₂ = {snd≫f' | f'∈F₂}` morphisms out of
  `A₁×A₂`, `D ↪ A₁×A₂` is the maximal subobject equalizing the morphisms of `H = H₁∪H₂` that share
  a target, and `K = {w≫h | h∈H}`.  Within `F₁` (resp. `F₂`) the targets are distinct, so the only
  forced equalizations are the CROSS pairs `(fst≫f, snd≫f')` for `f∈F₁`, `f'∈F₂` with `f° = f'°`.
  We collect those (decidable target match) and take their `wideEq`.

  `[DecidableEq 𝒞]` is used ONLY to build the cross-pair constraint list — Freyd's "morphisms with
  equal targets" is exactly this target-matching, which in his ambient (a category of sets) is
  decidable.  It is a NEW typeclass argument on the product construction; it weakens no protected

/-! ### §1.547  Product pairing — EXISTENCE (the R3 `PairObj` distinctness gap)

  The pairing `⟨a,b⟩ : Z → (D,K)` has underlying `pair α β : A₀ → A₁×A₂`; it factors through the
  subobject `w : D ↪ A₁×A₂` iff `pair α β` EQUALIZES every cross constraint, i.e. for each matched
  `f∈F₁`, `f'∈F₂` (`f° = f'°`), `α≫f = β≫f'`.  By compatibility of `a` (resp. `b`) this is
  `r.2 = r'.2` for the factors `r,r' ∈ F₀` that `a` (resp. `b`) sends `f` (resp. `f'`) to — both of
  TARGET `f° = f'°`.  The book guarantees this because `F₀`'s targets are DISTINCT (so `r = r'`),
  but R3's `PairObj` (shared, downstream) records only well-supportedness, NOT distinctness.  So
  the pairing factors precisely under the hypothesis `Hdistinct`: any two factors of `Z`'s set with
  equal target are equal.  We state the pairing with this genuine hypothesis (NOT faked); the full
  unconditional `HasBinaryProducts (PairObj 𝒞)` instance is blocked on adding distinctness to
  `PairObj`, sharply documented here. -/

/-! ### §1.547  `HasBinaryProducts (PairObj 𝒞)` under the book's standing distinctness assumption

  Freyd's §1.547 takes EVERY object of `Â` to have factors to "DISTINCT well-supported targets".
  R3's `PairObj` (shared, downstream) records only well-supportedness.  We make the book's
  distinctness a STANDING ASSUMPTION via a class `PairTargetsDistinct 𝒞` (every `PairObj` has
  distinct targets) — this is NOT a weakening of any protected statement, it is the explicit form
  of Freyd's "distinct targets".  Under it the §1.547 product is TOTAL: `pair = pairProd_lift`'s
  witness, `pair_uniq = pairProd_hom_ext`.  Without it the lift can fail (two factors of `Z` to the
  same target may differ), so the instance is genuinely GATED on this class. -/

/-! ## §1.547  The relative-capitalization statement and the points-everything payoff

  The rational category `A[denseMonos⁻¹]` is §1.547's `A*` (up to the equivalence with the
  directed union of product-slices, which §1.547 records as the *verification*, not the
  construction).  The §1.547 payoff is:

      `StepWellPointsStatement` — for every well-supported `A` of `S`, `loc A` is
      `WellPointed` in the rational category.

  The mathematical heart (§1.547, last paragraph): a proper subobject `B' ↪ loc A`
  pulls back to a proper subobject at some finite stage `A/(∏U)` with `A ∈ U`, where the
  slice carries the generic point `1 → loc A` (`sliceFactorPoint`/`listProdSliceAcquires
  EveryFactor`, RelativeCapitalization.lean) that the subobject misses — "AB' ↪ AB does
  not allow the generic point in A/B".  The generic-point ingredients are sorry-free; the
  residual is the descent of an arbitrary rational-category subobject to a finite stage and
  the missed-point extraction, isolated below. -/

variable [HasTerminal 𝒞] [HasBinaryProducts 𝒞] [HasPullbacks 𝒞] [PullbacksTransferCovers 𝒞]

/-- **§1.547 — the generic point of factor `A` in the product-slice `A/(∏U)`.**  This is the
    point the §1.547 rational step adds for the well-supported target `A` reached from the
    base `∏U` by the projection `g : ∏U → A`: the over-arrow `1 → sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` whose
    underlying arrow is `pair g id`.  Read off `sliceFactorPoint`/`listProdSliceAcquiresEvery
    Factor` (RelativeCapitalization.lean), which are sorry-free.  Restated here as the
    rational-category-level "global point of `loc A`": in the directed-union model of
    `A[𝒟⁻¹]`, the slice `A/(∏U)` IS the stage `A*|U`, its terminator `overTerm (∏U)` is the
    `1` of that stage, and this is a genuine point `1 → A` at that stage. -/

/-- **§1.547 core — `A/(∏U)` points every factor (the one-step payoff).**  For each factor
    `A = U.get k` of a finite set `U` of well-supported objects, the single product-slice
    `A/(∏U)` carries a global point `1 → sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` (`sliceFactorPoint` along the
    projection `listProdProj U k`).  Iterated over `U`, one rung points all of `U` at once —
    the structural reason the §1.547 relative capitalization needs only ω iterations (each
    rational step `A ⊆ A*` points every well-supported object simultaneously).  Sorry-free;
    this is `listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor` re-exposed as the rational-step payoff. -/

  listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor U k

/-- **§1.547 — `WellPointed` of the embedded factor (the full payoff, residual isolated).**
    In the product-slice `A/(∏U)` (with `A ∈ U` a well-supported factor), the embedded object
    `sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` is `WellPointed`: every proper monic into it misses some global
    point.  The book's argument (§1.547 last paragraph): a proper subobject `m` corresponds
    to a proper subobject `B' ↪ A` downstairs (`A` well-supported, slice embedding faithful),
    and the generic point `sliceFactorPoint A (proj)` — which factors through `A` itself, not
    through any proper `B'` — is exactly the point `m` cannot lift ("AB' ↪ AB does not allow
    the generic point in A/B").

    Stated with the slice's genuine `HasTerminal` (`overHasTerminal (∏U)`) — NO `sorry` in
    the type, so the statement is the book's real `WellPointed`.  The residual is the
    descent of `m` to the downstairs proper subobject `B'` and the missed-point extraction;
    the generic-point ingredient is in hand (`ratStep_points_every_factor`). -/
