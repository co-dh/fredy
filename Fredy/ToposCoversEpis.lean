  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §1.913 — COVERS = EPICS.

  "In any cartesian category with a subobject classifier, covers coincide with epics."
  (Book §1.913, the statement just before §1.914.)

  The book's argument: every subobject `A' ↪ A` appears as the equalizer of `χ_{A'}` and
  `(A → 1 → Ω)` (the classifier square is a pullback, hence an equalizer once the right leg
  is the universal point).  Consequently:

    * COVER ⟹ EPIC: a cover is right-cancellable (`cover_epi`, S1_52, needs only finite
      products + pullbacks — independent of the classifier).
    * EPIC ⟹ COVER: an epic `f` that factors `g ≫ m = f` through a monic `m` makes `m`
      epic; an epic monic in a category with a subobject classifier is an isomorphism
      (`epi_mono_is_iso` below), so `m` is iso and `f` is a cover.

  This is the §1.913 building block the §1.933 route to `PullbacksTransferCovers` rests on
  ("covers coincide with epics; any functor with a right adjoint preserves epics").  It is
  ADDITIVE: a single new file, no existing proof touched.  It needs ONLY the topos's
  `HasSubobjectClassifier` (terminal + pullbacks + classifier) and `HasBinaryProducts`,
  all of which a `Topos` supplies — no power objects, no exponentials, no §1.54.

/-- **§1.913 key lemma: an epic monic is an isomorphism**, in any cartesian category with a
    subobject classifier.

    `m : C ↪ Y` is the pullback of the universal point `true : 1 → Ω` along its characteristic
    map `χ_m`.  Since `term C = m ≫ term Y` (terminal uniqueness), the classifier square reads
    `m ≫ χ_m = m ≫ (term Y ≫ true)`; `m` epic cancels it to `χ_m = term Y ≫ true`.  Then
    `id_Y` together with `term Y` is a cone over `(χ_m, true)`, so the pullback UMP yields a
    section `r : Y → C` with `r ≫ m = id_Y`.  `m` monic upgrades this to a two-sided inverse. -/

/-- **§1.913 (epic ⟹ cover)**: in a cartesian category with a subobject classifier, every
    epimorphism is a cover.  If `f` factors `g ≫ m = f` through a monic `m`, then `m` is epic
    (right-cancel `f` epic), hence iso by `epi_mono_is_iso`; so every monic `f` factors through
    is iso, i.e. `f` is a cover. -/
