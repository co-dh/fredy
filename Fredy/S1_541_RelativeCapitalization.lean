  RELATIVE CAPITALIZATION — the genuine core of the capitalization successor step.

  This file builds the *slice rung* of Freyd's relative capitalization `A ⊆ A*`
  (§1.544/§1.545) as an honest `CapStep` (the successor interface of
  `Capitalization.lean`), for a *single* well-supported object `B`:

      A  →  A/B          ( C ↦ (C×B → B),  f ↦ (f×B) )

  The book (§1.544) writes this embedding as `A ↦ A×B` and shows it "separates
  objects and, if `B` is well-supported, separates morphisms."  The slice `A/B`
  is pre-regular (`overPreRegular`, SliceRegular.lean), the embedding is faithful
  (`slice_embedding_separates`, S1_54.lean — repackaged here as a faithful functor
  *into `Over B`*), so it packages as a `CapStep A`.

  WHAT THIS FILE DELIVERS (all Sorry-free):
    * `sliceEmbedObj` / `sliceEmbedMap` / `sliceEmbedFunctor`
                            — the functor `A → A/B`, `C ↦ ⟨C×B, snd⟩`, `f ↦ f×B`
    * `sliceEmbedFaithful`  — it is FAITHFUL when `B` is well-supported
                              (embedding from `slice_embedding_separates`;
                               reflects-iso from `f×B` iso ⟹ `f` mono+cover ⟹ iso)
    * (§1.545 rung `A → A/B` is the faithful pre-regular extension above; the `CapStep`
       the ω-tower iterates is the §1.547 colimit `nextStepOfEnum`, not a single slice)
    * `sliceAcquiresPoint`  — `A/B` ACQUIRES A POINT of `sliceEmbed B B`: the
                               terminator-to-image diagonal `⟨diag B, …⟩ : 1 → B×B`
                               is a point of `sliceEmbedObj B B`.  This is §1.546's
                               "generic point" `1 → A(B)` for the chosen `B`.
    * `sliceFactorPoint` / `sliceAcquiresFactorPoint`
                            — §1.547 generalization: along ANY `g : P → B`, the slice
                               `A/P` acquires a point of `sliceEmbedObj P B`
                               (underlying arrow `pair g id_P`).  With `P = ∏U`,
                               `g = projection`, this is the point the product-slice
                               rung adds for a factor `B ∈ U`.
    * `prodSliceAcquiresBothFactors`
                            — the two-factor crux: the SINGLE slice `A/(B×B')` points
                               BOTH factors at once, so one rung over `∏U` points every
                               member of `U` simultaneously.
    * `listProd` / `listProdProj` / `listSubset` / `listDirected`
                            — the §1.547 FINITE-SET INDEX (mathlib-free): finite sets of
                               objects modelled as `List 𝒞`, `⊆`-ordered into a `Directed`
                               (bound = `++`); `∏U` = right-folded binary product (`∏[]=1`);
                               `listProdProj U k : ∏U → U.get k` the factor projection
                               (`Fin`-indexed — a `Prop`-membership `B ∈ U` cannot large-
                               eliminate into a morphism).
    * `listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor`
                            — the §1.547 payoff: `A/(∏U)` acquires a point of EVERY factor
                               `U.get k` at once (one rung points all of `U`).

  STATUS: §1.543 is now PROVEN Sorry-free (`Fredy.capitalization_lemma`, in
  `Fredy/CapDataWiring.lean`).  The uniform successor was ultimately built by the
  COFINAL (object-indexed) route — `uniformStep` (`Fredy/UniformCapStep.lean`) over the
  `cofinalProjSystem` (`Fredy/CofinalProjSystem.lean`), using `Classical.decEq` — NOT by
  closing the `innerCatSystem` route this header explored.  The discussion below is the
  historical exploration of the per-`B` slice rung that this file delivers (Sorry-free) and
  feeds into that solution; the "residual wall" / "STILL OPEN" framing it uses is superseded.

  THE GENUINE STRENGTHENING (recorded for context).
  The *uniform* successor `nextStep : ∀ S, CapStep S` is
  STRONGER than a single slice rung: in ONE category `S*` it must add a point for
  *every* well-supported `B` simultaneously (Freyd's §1.547 rational category / the
  directed union of the `A* | U = A/(∏U)` product-slices over finite sets `U` of
  well-supported objects).  This file delivers the per-`B`/per-factor points AND the
  finite-set index (`listDirected`/`listProd`/`listProdProj`/`listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor`)
  Sorry-free (above).

  INNER-SYSTEM SCAFFOLDING (this session, all Sorry-free — see the `innerCatSystem` block):
    * the TRANSITION FUNCTOR now EXISTS: `baseChangeFunctor (g : C ⟶ D) : Functor (Over D → Over C)`
      (SliceRegular.lean), the genuine slice→slice base-change `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` by pullback along
      `∏U → ∏V` — NOT the slice embedding (which is `A → A/B`, base→one-slice).
    * `innerObj U = Over (listProd U)`, `innerCat`, `innerF P h = baseChangeObj (P.proj h)`,
      `innerFunctF P h = baseChangeFunctor (P.proj h)` — the inner system's object family, `Cat`
      instances, transition object map and per-rung functoriality.
    * `innerCatSystem P hS : CatSystem (List 𝒞) listDirected` — the inner system, GIVEN its two
      residuals as honest inputs (no false `Sorry`):
        (A) `P : ListProjFamily` — a choice-free product projection `∏U ⟶ ∏V` per `V ⊆ U` with
            strict unit/composition.  NOT yet constructible: `listSubset V U` is a `Prop`, so a
            positional factor-match needs `DecidableEq 𝒞` (the same `Prop`-no-large-elim wall that
            forced `listProdProj` to be `Fin`-indexed).
        (B-strict) `hS : StrictBaseChange P` — the on-the-nose `F_refl`/`F_trans`.  RAW base-change
            is only PSEUDO-functorial (`baseChangeObj (Cat.id) X = X×_D D`, iso to `X` but NOT equal),
            so these are FALSE for raw base-change and are declared as a hypothesis (a real theorem to
            prove = base-change strictification), never asserted by `Sorry`.

  ROUTE-1 (strict reindexing) INVESTIGATION — settled NEGATIVELY for §1.547, see the
  `strictReindexSystem` block + `Freyd.reindexFunctor` (SliceRegular.lean):
    * the STRICT transition EXISTS — `reindexFunctor m` (Σ / post-composition along `m : C → D`) is
      strictly functorial AND `reindexObj_id`/`reindexObj_comp` give `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` ON
      THE NOSE (Sorry-free, axiom-free).  `strictReindexSystem R` is a genuine `CatSystem` with those
      laws as THEOREMS, no `StrictBaseChange` needed.
    * but it is the WRONG transition for §1.547: variance `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` needs base map `∏V → ∏U`
      (Σ-direction), not choice-free for `V ⊆ U` (would manufacture the missing factors' points); and
      Σ keeps the slice DOMAIN fixed (`B×∏V`), so it cannot connect the stage embeddings whose domain
      must GROW to `B×∏U`.  Only base-change (pullback) grows the domain — hence pseudo-functorial.
      Strictness and the growing-product embedding are mutually exclusive; route 1 does not close
      `hwall_step`.
  (This `innerCatSystem` route was NOT the one taken to close `S*`.  The actual uniform
  successor is the cofinal `uniformStep` / `cofinalProjSystem` route — see the STATUS note
  above — which sidesteps both the (B-package) coherence/preservation obligations for
  `innerCatSystem` and the (B-import) cycle, by living downstream in
  `Fredy/CapDataWiring.lean`.  §1.543 is proven there.)

  No mathlib (the category theory stays on this repo's own `Cat`).

/-! ## §1.544  The slice embedding `A → A/B` as a functor

  Object part: `C ↦ ⟨C×B, snd⟩` — the product `C×B` viewed as an object over `B`
  via the second projection.  Morphism part: `f : C → D` maps to `f×B = pair (fst≫f) snd`,
  which is an `OverHom` because `pair (fst≫f) snd ≫ snd = snd` (`snd_pair`).

  The underlying `𝒞`-arrow of `(sliceEmbed B).map f` is exactly `(prodRightFunctor B).map f`,
  so all functor laws and faithfulness reduce to the already-proven `prodRightFunctor` /
  `slice_embedding_separates`. -/

/-! ### Faithfulness of the slice embedding (§1.544)

  Embedding: equality of slice-images gives equality of underlying `f×B`, which
  `slice_embedding_separates` (cover-cancellation of `fst`, needs `B` well-supported)
  turns into `f = g`.

  Reflects-iso: from `f×B` iso we get `f` *mono* (image `f×B` mono, then the embedding
  + functoriality descend monicity to `f`) and `f` a *cover* (`fst_C ≫ f = (f×B) ≫ fst_D`
  is iso∘cover hence a cover, and a cover right-factor is a cover); `monic_cover_iso`
  then makes `f` iso. -/

    well-supported `B`.  This is `slice_embedding_separates` read through the underlying-arrow

/-! ## §1.545  The slice rung as a faithful pre-regular extension

  `A → A/B` is one rung of Freyd's relative capitalization — a faithful pre-regular extension
  of `A`: target `A/B` (pre-regular by `overPreRegular`), functor `sliceEmbedFunctor`, faithful
  by `sliceEmbedFaithful`.  (A `CapStep`-packaged form is no longer materialised here: `CapStep`
  now additionally carries the five limit- and cover-preservation fields the ω-tower consumes, and the
  successor the tower actually iterates is the §1.547 enumeration colimit `nextStepOfEnum` — into
  `A/(∏U)` over a chain of finite factor-sets — not a single slice `A/B`.  The §1.545 content used
  downstream is exactly `sliceEmbedFaithful`/`overPreRegular`/`sliceAcquiresPoint`.) -/

/-! ## §1.546  The slice rung acquires the generic point of `B`

  In `A/B`, the terminator is `overTerm B = ⟨B, id_B⟩` (S1_44).  Freyd's "generic point"
  of `A(B) = sliceEmbedObj B B = ⟨B×B, snd⟩` is the slice-arrow `1 → A(B)` whose underlying
  `𝒞`-arrow is the diagonal `diag B : B → B×B` (`diag B ≫ snd = id_B` makes it an over-hom
  from the terminator).  This is the point that §1.546's relative capitalization adds for `B`. -/

/-- The **generic point** of `sliceEmbedObj B B` in `A/B`: the over-arrow from the terminator
    `⟨B, id_B⟩` whose underlying arrow is the diagonal `diag B : B → B×B`.  It is an `OverHom`
    because `diag B ≫ snd = id_B` (the second projection of the diagonal is the identity). -/

    `1 → sliceEmbedObj B B` in `A/B` (its source is the terminator `overTerm B`, which is the
    `1` of `A/B`).  This is the generic point Freyd's relative capitalization adds for the
    chosen well-supported `B`. -/

/-! ## §1.547  Product slices acquire a point of every factor

  Freyd's choice-free relative capitalization (§1.547) is the directed union of the
  slices `A* | U = A / (∏ U)` over finite sets `U` of well-supported objects, with the
  transition `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` (for `V ⊆ U`) being the slice embedding.  The point that
  the rung over `U` must add for a *factor* `B ∈ U` is read off the slice over the product:
  the projection `g : ∏U → B` is a map to a well-supported target, and `A/(∏U)` acquires a
  point of `sliceEmbedObj (∏U) B` along `g`.  The two-factor case `∏U = B × B'` below is the
  crux: ONE slice (over the product) simultaneously points BOTH factors, which is exactly why
  the finite-product directed union pins down a point per well-supported object at once.

  This generalizes `sliceGenericPoint`/`sliceAcquiresPoint` (the `B = ∏U` self-point case)
  to an arbitrary projection `g : ∏U → B`.  Below, `g` is any map into a (well-supported)
  target `B` from the base `P = ∏U`; the point's underlying arrow is `pair g (Cat.id P)`. -/

/-- **Generic point of a factor in a product slice (§1.547).**  For any base `P` and any
    map `g : P → B`, the slice `A/P` acquires a point of `sliceEmbedObj P B = ⟨B × P, snd⟩`:
    the over-arrow from the terminator `⟨P, id_P⟩` whose underlying `𝒞`-arrow is
    `pair g (id_P) : P → B × P`.  It is an `OverHom` because its second projection is `id_P`
    (`snd_pair`).  Taking `g = fst : B × B' → B` points the factor `B` of `B × B'`; taking
    `P = B`, `g = id_B` recovers `sliceGenericPoint B` (the diagonal). -/

/-- **§1.547 — `A/P` acquires a point of `sliceEmbedObj P B` along `g : P → B`.**
    `sliceFactorPoint B g` is a point `1 → sliceEmbedObj P B` in `A/P` (source = the
    terminator `overTerm P`).  This is the generic point the product-slice rung adds for the
    well-supported target `B` reached from the base `P` by `g`. -/

  exact snd_pair g (Cat.id P)

/-- **Both factors of a binary product slice are pointed (§1.547, two-factor crux).**
    The single slice `A/(B × B')` acquires, from its own base, a point of the factor `B`
    (along `fst`) AND a point of the factor `B'` (along `snd`).  This is the elementary fact
    behind "the slice over the *product* of `U` points every member of `U` simultaneously":
    iterating it over a finite `U` (its product carries a projection to each member) gives one
    rung that points all of `U` at once, the content of the directed-union construction. -/

/-! ## §1.547  The finite-set index and the product over a finite set

  Freyd's choice-free relative capitalization (§1.547) is the directed union of the slices
  `A* | U = A/(∏U)` over *finite sets* `U` of (well-supported) objects, with transition
  `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` for `V ⊆ U`.  The repo is mathlib-free, so we model a "finite set of
  objects" as a `List 𝒞` and the order `V ⊆ U` as list-membership inclusion.  This is a
  genuine `Directed` index (`bound` = append), and `∏U` is the right-folded binary product
  of the members of `U` (with `∏[] = 1`, the terminator).  These are the concrete, reusable
  ingredients of the inner directed system; everything below is Sorry-free. -/

-- `listProd`/`listProd_nil`/`listProd_cons` now live upstream in `Fredy.SliceRegular`
-- (imported above) so that `Fredy.Inflation` can use them without importing `Capitalization`.

/-- The projection `∏U → B` for the factor at a positional index `k : Fin U.length` (so
    `B = U.get k`).  Positional indexing (rather than a `Prop`-valued membership `B ∈ U`) is
    forced: `B ∈ U` lives in `Prop`, so a *morphism* `∏U → B` cannot be extracted from it by
    recursion (large elimination of a `Prop` into `Type` is barred).  `Fin`-indexing carries
    the data: head index projects by `fst`; a successor index projects by `snd` then recurses.
    This is the map `g : ∏U → U.get k` along which the slice `A/(∏U)` acquires a point of that
    factor (`sliceFactorPoint`/`sliceAcquiresFactorPoint`). -/

/-! ## §1.546 — the directed-union escape: base-change to a FRESH factor misses its point

  The genuine §1.546 density content, isolated as a single Sorry-free SLICE lemma.

  Freyd's §1.546: a proper subobject of the embedded object `AB ↪ B` is, at a RICHER slice, missed
  by a point.  At a single fixed slice this is FALSE (`properMono_forces_graph_iso`,
  SliceEquivalence): the graph `pair (proj_k) id` of the generic slice point is a proper mono
  reaching every fixed-slice point.  The escape is the directed union: pass to a richer base
  `P' = A × P` carrying a FRESH, independent `A`-coordinate `c : P' → A` (the new projection), and
  base-change the subobject along the projection `q : P' → P`.  The base-changed subobject's
  `A`-value is the OLD subobject's `A`-value pulled back through `P`, so it is DECOUPLED from the
  fresh coordinate `c`; reaching the fresh point `sliceFactorPoint A c` would force the old
  subobject to contain its whole graph, i.e. force the proper mono to be a cover — contradiction.

  This is the precise, point-free reason the directed UNION (not a single slice) closes §1.546, and
  it needs NO fractions-saturation: only the two base-change pullback squares and joint-monicity of
  `(fst, snd)`.  The lemma is stated against the explicit pullback cones so it is reusable for any
  base map `q` and any fresh coordinate `c` with `c`'s `P`-shadow factoring as `q`. -/

/-- **§1.546 base-change escape (the genuine directed-union escape, Sorry-free).**  Let
    `m : D ↪ sliceEmbedObj P A` be a PROPER slice mono (`D.dom ↪ A×P` with structure `snd`).
    Base-change along the SECOND PROJECTION `q := snd : A×P ⟶ P` (so the richer base is `P' = A×P`,
    carrying the FRESH `A`-coordinate `fst : A×P ⟶ A`).  Suppose:

      * `cnD : Cone D.hom (snd : prod A P ⟶ P)` is a pullback (the base-change of `D`);
      * `mf' : cnD.pt ⟶ prod A (prod A P)` is the induced map on the base-changed embedded apex —
        we take that apex to be the canonical `A × (A×P)` product cone of the cospan
        `(snd, snd)`, with legs `fst`, `snd`.  So `mf'` satisfies
        `mf' ≫ fst = cnD.π₁ ≫ m.f ≫ fst` (the `A`-leg of `D ↪ A×P`) and `mf' ≫ snd = cnD.π₂`
        (the base leg, landing in `A×P = P'`).

    Then there is NO section `s : (prod A P) ⟶ cnD.pt` of the base-change structure map `cnD.π₂`
    (`s ≫ cnD.π₂ = id`) whose `A`-coordinate is the FRESH coordinate `fst`
    (`s ≫ mf' ≫ fst = fst`).  For such a section makes `(s ≫ cnD.π₁) : A×P → D.dom` a SECTION of
    `m.f` (`(s ≫ cnD.π₁) ≫ m.f = pair fst snd = id_{A×P}`), so `m.f` is split-epi hence a cover;
    being monic (`m` mono), `m.f` is then iso, so `m` is a slice-iso — contradicting properness.

    This is the precise point-free directed-union escape; no fractions saturation is used. -/

    §1.546 directed-union escape as `baseChange_freshFactor_missed`, but stated to consume a
    *point factorization* directly: at the richer base `P' = A×P` (the fresh `A`-coordinate is
    `fst : A×P ⟶ A`), if the FRESH slice point `sliceFactorPoint A (fst : A×P ⟶ A)` factors through
    a PROPER slice mono `m̄ : D̄ ↪ sliceEmbedObj (A×P) A` whose domain `D̄` is the base-change of the
    proper mono `m : D ↪ sliceEmbedObj P A` along `snd : A×P ⟶ P`, then `False`.

    Concretely the hypotheses present the base-change by its pullback cone `cnD` of `D.hom` along
    `snd` (so `D̄.dom = cnD.pt`, `D̄.hom = cnD.π₂`) and the embedded-apex comparison `m̄.f = mf'` with
    `mf' ≫ fst = cnD.π₁ ≫ m.f ≫ fst`, `mf' ≫ snd = cnD.π₂` — exactly the data

    `baseChange_freshFactor_missed` refutes it.

    This is the reusable consumer of a POINT factorization (an `OverHom` equation), the shape a

/-! ## §1.547  Assembling the inner finite-product-slice `CatSystem` (residual (A)/(B))

  This block builds the inner directed system of slices `A/(∏U)` over `listDirected`, the
  one `hwall_step` (Capitalization.lean) consumes.  The OBJECTS (`Over (listProd U)`), the
  INDEX (`listDirected`), and the per-rung POINTS (`listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor`) are all
  in hand Sorry-free above.  Two concrete primitives remain, isolated here as the interface
  `ListProjFamily` (and an `import` obstruction that keeps the assembly in *this* file rather
  than in `Capitalization.lean`):

  ════ residual (A) — the choice-free TRANSITION BASE MORPHISM ════
  The transition `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` for `V ⊆ U` is BASE-CHANGE (`baseChangeObj`/`baseChangeFunctor`,
  SliceRegular.lean) along a product projection `listProd U ⟶ listProd V`.  That projection is
  NOT constructible choice-free over the present index: `listSubset V U` is `∀ x ∈ V, x ∈ U`, a
  `Prop`, so a *positional* match "factor `k` of `V` = factor `?` of `U`" cannot be extracted
  without `DecidableEq 𝒞` (object equality) — exactly the same `Prop`-can't-large-eliminate wall
  that forced `listProdProj` to be `Fin`-indexed rather than `(B ∈ U)`-indexed.  The honest
  abstraction is therefore to take the projection family as DATA (`ListProjFamily` below); the
  genuine missing primitive is one constructive instance of it.

  ════ residual (B-strict) — base-change is only PSEUDO-functorial ════
  `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` demand ON-THE-NOSE equalities `F (refl) X = X` and
  `F (trans) X = F hjk (F hij X)`.  Base-change along `1` is `X ×_D D → D`, equal to `X` only up
  to iso, and base-change along a composite re-associates pullbacks — both hold only up to
  canonical iso, never definitionally (probed: `baseChangeObj (Cat.id D) X = X` does not reduce).
  The outer ω-tower sidestepped this by transporting via `transN` (literal iterated composition,
  strictly functorial).  The inner system needs the same strictification of base-change (or a
  strictly-functorial replacement transition), which is a standalone construction.

  ════ residual (B-import) — the assembly cannot live in `Capitalization.lean` ════
  `RelativeCapitalization` imports `Capitalization` (for `CapStep`), so the ingredients
  `listDirected`/`baseChangeFunctor`/`listProd`/`listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor` are visible
  ONLY here, downstream of `hwall_step`.  Discharging it in place would require moving
  the inner-system ingredients up into a file that `Capitalization` imports (e.g. `SliceRegular`),
  or relocating `capData_exists` down here.

  RESOLUTION (since written): the relocation route was taken — `capData_exists` lives downstream
  in `Fredy/CapDataWiring.lean`, and residual (A) was discharged by accepting `Classical.decEq`
  for the positional projection (the §1.543 exception, `Fredy/CofinalProjSystem.lean`).  §1.543 is
  now PROVEN Sorry-free; this block records the obstructions of the *abandoned* in-place route. -/

/-- **The transition base-morphism family (residual (A), as data).**  A choice-free assignment,
    for every inclusion `V ⊆ U` of finite object-sets, of a product projection
    `listProd U ⟶ listProd V` (the bigger product projects onto the smaller), STRICTLY coherent:
    the identity inclusion gives `Cat.id`, and a composite inclusion gives the composite
    projection.  This is exactly the data missing from residual (A); one constructive instance of
    it (needing `DecidableEq 𝒞` or a positional refinement of the index) closes residual (A).

    Given such a family, the inner system's transition is `baseChangeFunctor (proj h)`; its strict
    coherence laws are residual (B-strict) — base-change is only pseudo-functorial, so even with a
    strict `ListProjFamily` the `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` need base-change strictification. -/

    these equations are **false** (`baseChangeObj (Cat.id (∏U)) X = X ×_{∏U} ∏U → ∏U`, canonically
    iso to `X` but NOT equal; the composite re-associates the iterated pullback).  We therefore
    DECLARE the strict laws as a hypothesis bundle rather than discharge them with a false `Sorry`:
    a witness of `StrictBaseChange P` is exactly the base-change strictification (or a strictly
    functorial replacement transition) needed before `innerObj`/`innerF` form a `CatSystem`.

    This is residual (B-strict) stated honestly: providing `StrictBaseChange P` is a real theorem
    (it does NOT hold for raw base-change), so there is no false-statement-with-`Sorry` here. -/

    `colimitPreRegular` preservation hypotheses and `Coherent` (residual (B-package), mirroring the

    ROUTE-1 NOTE (see the `strictReindexSystem` block below).  `hS : StrictBaseChange P` is a GENUINE
    obligation — base-change is irreducibly pseudo-functorial.  The natural strict alternative (Σ /
    post-composition, `strictReindexSystem`) discharges the strict `F_refl`/`F_trans` on the nose but
    runs the WRONG variance and keeps the slice domain fixed, so it cannot carry §1.547's growing
    embedding.  Hence `StrictBaseChange` cannot be replaced by route-1 reindexing; it stays. -/

/-! ## ROUTE 1 — strict reindexing: the strict laws hold, but the variance is wrong

  Investigation of the §1.543 task "replace the pseudo-functorial base-change transition with a
  STRICTLY functorial one so `CatSystem.F_refl`/`F_trans` hold on the nose."

  RESULT (machine-checked, Sorry-free below).  The honest strict transition is the dependent-sum /
  post-composition functor `reindexFunctor` (SliceRegular.lean): along a FIXED base map `m : C ⟶ D`,
  `Σ_m : A/C → A/D`, `⟨X, x⟩ ↦ ⟨X, x ≫ m⟩`.  It is STRICTLY functorial and — unlike base-change —
  satisfies the `CatSystem` object laws DEFINITIONALLY:

    * `reindexObj_id   : reindexObj (Cat.id C) X = X`                           (strict `F_refl`)
    * `reindexObj_comp : reindexObj (m ≫ m') X = reindexObj m' (reindexObj m X)` (strict `F_trans`)

  both proven by `rfl`-level rewriting (`Cat.comp_id` / `Cat.assoc`).  So a `CatSystem` built on
  `reindexFunctor` needs NO `StrictBaseChange` hypothesis: `strictReindexSystem` below has its
  `F_refl`/`F_trans` as PROVEN theorems, not fed-in inputs.  This is the route-1 strict win, in hand.

  WHY ROUTE 1 NEVERTHELESS CANNOT CARRY §1.547 (the two-fold obstruction, both `rfl`-confirmed):

   (i) WRONG VARIANCE.  `reindexFunctor` runs `A/C → A/D` ALONG a base map `m : C → D`.  The §1.547
       directed transition is `A/(∏V) → A/(∏U)` for `V ⊆ U`, whose canonical, choice-free base map is
       the PROJECTION `listProdProj`-style `∏U → ∏V` (bigger product onto smaller) — pointing the
       WRONG way for Σ.  A Σ-usable `∏V → ∏U` would have to MANUFACTURE the extra factors of `U∖V`,
       i.e. supply points `1 → B` for the new well-supported `B`; choice-free, no such map exists
       (that is precisely the point the construction is trying to ADD, not assume).  Hence the strict
       family `ReindexFamily` (the Σ analogue of `ListProjFamily`) carries data `∏V ⟶ ∏U` that is NOT
       constructible — strictly worse than `ListProjFamily`'s `∏U ⟶ ∏V`, which at least IS a genuine
       projection (blocked only by `Prop`-no-large-elim / `DecidableEq 𝒞`).

  (ii) BREAKS THE EMBEDDING.  Even granting such a family, Σ keeps the DOMAIN fixed:
       `(reindexObj m (sliceEmbedObj (∏V) B)).dom = (∏V).dom`-shape `= prod B (listProd V)`, NEVER
       `prod B (listProd U)` (confirmed by `rfl`).  But the slice embedding at stage `U` is
       `sliceEmbedObj (∏U) B = ⟨B × ∏U, snd⟩`, whose domain GREW to `B × ∏U`.  The colimit must
       identify `objIncl V (embed B) = objIncl U (embed B)`, i.e. the transition must connect
       `⟨B×∏V, snd⟩` to `⟨B×∏U, snd⟩` — a domain CHANGE `B×∏V ↝ B×∏U`.  Only the pullback/base-change
       direction does this (`X ↦ X ×_{∏V} ∏U`); Σ cannot, since it never touches the domain.  This is
       the structural reason §1.547's directed union is the pullback (rational-category) construction,
       NOT a strict reindexing — and is exactly why Freyd phrases the `A*|U`-to-`A*|V` transitions as
       *equivalences of full subcategories of the rational category*, i.e. up-to-iso, never on the nose.

  CONCLUSION.  Route 1 produces a genuine, hypothesis-free strict `CatSystem` (`strictReindexSystem`)
  but on the WRONG variance and WITHOUT the embedding/point-acquisition §1.547 needs.  The base-change
  inner system (`innerCatSystem`) keeps the correct variance and embedding but is irreducibly
  pseudo-functorial (its `StrictBaseChange` is a real, non-trivial strictification obligation).  The
  two cannot be merged: strictness and the growing-product embedding pull in opposite directions.  So
  route-1 reindexing does NOT close the successor here; the way it WAS closed (now PROVEN Sorry-free,
  §1.543) is the rational-category route: a directed-union-of-full-subcategories model whose
  inclusions are up-to-iso, built as `uniformStep` over the cofinal `cofinalProjSystem`
  (`Fredy/UniformCapStep.lean`, `Fredy/CofinalProjSystem.lean`, `Fredy/CapDataWiring.lean`). -/

    of a base map `∏V ⟶ ∏U` per inclusion `V ⊆ U`, strictly coherent.  NOTE the direction `∏V → ∏U`:
    this is what `Σ` (post-composition) requires, and is NOT choice-free constructible — a map
    `∏V → ∏U` for `V ⊆ U` must supply the missing factors `U∖V` (points `1 → B`), the very data the
    capitalization is meant to ADD.  Carried as a structure to make the obstruction explicit. -/

    Given a (route-1) base-map family `R`, the Σ-transition system over `listDirected` is a genuine
    `CatSystem` whose `F_refl`/`F_trans` are PROVEN — `reindexObj_id` and `reindexObj_comp` (modulo
    `R.base_refl`/`R.base_trans`), NOT supplied as `StrictBaseChange`-style hypotheses.  This is the
    concrete route-1 deliverable: strict laws ARE dischargeable on the nose for the reindexing
    transition.  Its limitation (wrong variance + fixed domain, so it does NOT carry the §1.547
    embedding/point-acquisition) is documented above and is why this route was abandoned in favour
    of the rational-category `uniformStep` that actually closes §1.543 (now proven). -/

/-! ## §1.546/§1.547  The uniform relative-capitalization successor `nextStep`

  This block assembles Freyd's relative-capitalization successor `S ↦ S*` as a single
  uniform `CapStep S` (the keystone the outer ω-tower iterates).  The pieces:

    * `wellSupported_one`/`wellSupported_prod`/`wellSupported_listProd` — `WellSupported (∏U)`
      whenever every member of the list `U` is well-supported.
    * The faithful BASE EMBEDDING `S → innerSliceObj ([] : Infl S)` — `X ↦ ⟨[X], term⟩`,
      `f ↦ inflFunctor.map f`.  Faithful because the inflation cross-section `infl`
      (`prodRight 1`) separates morphisms (`fst : X×1 → X` is a cover, `1` well-supported)
      and the slice over the terminal of `Infl S` forgets nothing (its hom is `term`).
    * The COFINAL ENUMERATION — Classical-well-order the well-supported objects of `S`
      and build the `take`-prefix `PrefixChain`, so each appended suffix is a list of
      well-supported objects, hence `hwsuf` (every appended `∏d` well-supported) holds and
      `chainSlicePreRegularWS` makes the inner colimit `S* = (chainSliceSystem P).Obj`
      a concrete `PreRegularCategory`.
    * `nextStep S : CapStep S.carrier` = ⟨S*, base-embed ≫ stage-0 inclusion, faithful⟩. -/

/-- **§1.547 point acquisition at the chain stage.**  The stage-`(n+1)` slice of the enumeration
    chain, `innerSliceObj (enumPrefix enum (n+1)) = Over (∏[enum 0,…,enum n])`, acquires a point of

    (listProdProj …)` from the terminator, whose composite with the slice structure map is the
    terminator's (`sliceAcquiresFactorPoint`).  This is the §1.546 generic point the chain adds for
    `enum n`, read off via `listProdSliceAcquiresEveryFactor`; pushing it along the stage-inclusion
    into `S* = (chainSliceSystem (enumChain enum)).Obj` gives the colimit point (the WALL 2 input). -/
