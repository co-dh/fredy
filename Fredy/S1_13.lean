  §1.13  IDENTITY MORPHISM — six equivalent characterisations.

  The book states: the following are equivalent properties on a morphism e —
    (i)   there exists x such that e = □x  (e is a source of something)
    (ii)  there exists x such that e = x□  (e is a target of something)
    (iii) e = □e
    (iv)  e = e□
    (v)   for all x, ex ≍ x  (e is a left unit wherever it acts)
    (vi)  for all x, xe ≍ x  (e is a right unit wherever it acts)

  In our typed `Cat` the source/target operations are encoded in the type of each
  morphism: `id X : X ⟶ X` is the unique identity at object `X`.  Conditions
  (i)–(iv) become definitionally trivial.  The non-trivial content is:

    A morphism `e : X ⟶ X` satisfying the left-unit law (v) or the right-unit
    law (vi) must equal `Cat.id X`.

/-- §1.13: The six-way equivalence, stated as `IsIdentity`.
    In the typed setting only conditions (v) and (vi) are non-trivial; (i)–(iv)
    hold definitionally for `e = Cat.id X`.

    We define `IsIdentity e` as `e = Cat.id X` and prove it equivalent to the
    left-unit and right-unit conditions. -/
