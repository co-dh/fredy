  ## Lean tactics used in this file (for readers unfamiliar with Lean)

  `rw [h]`      — **rewrite**.  Replace the goal (or a hypothesis) using the
                  equality `h`.  `rw` searches for the left side of `h` in the
                  goal and replaces it with the right side.  `← h` rewrites
                  the other direction (right side → left side).

  `refine ⟨x, h₁, h₂⟩` — provide the components of an `∃` or `∧` goal one
                  by one.  `⟨a, b⟩` is syntax for a tuple; `?` marks a subgoal
                  to be proved in a later bullet `·`.

  `obtain ⟨g, hfg, hgf⟩ := hf` — **case split**.  If `hf : IsIso f` (i.e.
                  `∃ g, f ≫ g = id ∧ g ≫ f = id`), this names the witness
                  `g` and the two proofs `hfg`, `hgf`.

  `constructor` — split an `∧` goal into two separate subgoals.

  `dsimp`       — **definitional simplify**.  Unfolds definitions.

  `·`           — **bullet**.  Starts the proof of the next subgoal.

  `rfl`         — **reflexivity**.  Proves `x = x`.

  `by`          — enters **tactic mode** for a proof block.

/-- §1.18  A functor from `𝒞` to `𝒟`.

    `F : 𝒞 → 𝒟` is the map on objects.  The class provides:
    - `map`   : for each `f : X ⟶ Y`, a morphism `map f : F X ⟶ F Y`.
    - `map_id` / `map_comp` : preservation laws.

    In the book's single-sorted language, a functor is a function `F`
    on morphisms such that `□(Fx) = F(□x)`, `(Fx)□ = F(x□)`, and
    `F(xy) = (Fx)(Fy)`.  Our object-centric definition is equivalent. -/

  map_id : ∀ (X : C), map (Cat.id X) = Cat.id (F X)

/-! ### Cross-universe preservation/reflection of `Monic`

  The generic `Preserves`/`Reflects` above take the property as a `MorphProp`
  *parameter*, which fixes one object universe — so they only apply to functors
  whose source and target live in the same universe (e.g. endofunctors).  The
  slice forgetful functor `Σ : A/B → A` is genuinely cross-universe
  (`Over B : Type (max u v)` vs `A : Type u`), so we give `Monic`-specific
  versions: because `Monic` is applied *directly* (not through a parameter) and is
  itself universe-polymorphic, these work for `Functor`s between categories in
  different universes. -/

/-- **§1.181**: a functor preserves isomorphisms.

    If `f : X → Y` has a two-sided inverse in `𝒞`, then `F.map f`
    has a two-sided inverse in `𝒟`.  This is an instance of the
    general `Preserves` notion — every functor `Preserves` `@IsIso`. -/

/-- **§1.181**: the image of the inverse is an inverse of the image.

    If `g` is a specific two-sided inverse of `f` (so `f ≫ g = id_X`
    and `g ≫ f = id_Y`), then `F.map g` is a two-sided inverse of
    `F.map f`.  Returns both equations as a pair (`∧`). -/

/-! ## §1.182  Opposite category and contravariant functors

  The book defines `Aᵒᵖ` by keeping the same elements but swapping source/target
  and reversing composition: `x ∘ y` in `Aᵒᵖ` is `y ∘ x` in `A`.
  The identity function `A → Aᵒᵖ` is a contravariant isomorphism.

  `ContraFunctor` (§1.182 proper) is defined in S1_81.lean; it imports S1_18.
  We define `OppCat` here since it is a §1.182 concept. -/

/-- **§1.182**: The OPPOSITE CATEGORY `OppCat 𝒞` has the same objects as `𝒞`
    but reversed morphisms: `X ⟶ Y` in `OppCat 𝒞` means `Y ⟶ X` in `𝒞`,
    and composition is reversed (`x ∘ y` becomes `y ∘ x`). -/

/-! ## §1.19  Identity morphisms and the induced map

  `|A|` in the book denotes the set of identity morphisms of `A`.
  We represent this as the subtype `IdMorphs 𝒞 := { p : Σ X : 𝒞, X ⟶ X // p.2 = Cat.id p.1 }`,
  or more directly as just `𝒞` itself (each object has a unique identity morphism).
  The cleanest encoding: `IdMorphs 𝒞` is the type of pairs `(X, id_X)`. -/

    Each element is a pair of an object `X` and its identity morphism `id_X`. -/
