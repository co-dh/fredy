# §2.16(13) for the recursive category R: its effective reflection is NOT AC

The book's §2.16(13): if a regular category `C` is not effective, then its
effective reflection `Ĉ = Spl(Eq Rel(C))` is not an allegory of choice (AC) — covers
do not split there.

`Fredy/S1_572b_NotEffective.lean` (§1.572) exhibits the recursive category R
(objects `ExtNat`, morphisms recursive functions) as NON-effective: `ERel`, the r.e.
halting equivalence relation gluing `2e ~ 2e+1` exactly when `e` halts on itself, is
an equivalence relation of R (`ERel_equivalence`) but the level of no cover
(`ERel_not_effective`, ultimately `K_not_recursive`).

This file transports that fact through the Chapter-2 `Rel`/`Map` bridge
(`Fredy/S2_111_RelCat.lean`) and applies the general reflection theorem
`Freyd.Alg.not_coversSplit_of_not_effective` (`Fredy/S2_16c.lean`) to conclude:

  **`Freyd.RecEff.reflection_not_ac`** — `¬ CoversSplit (Spl(Eq (Rel ExtNat)))`.

The bridge is purely a change of encoding:

* `ERel` becomes the allegory endo-relation `eE := [ERel] : ⟨ω⟩ ⟶ ⟨ω⟩` of `Rel(R)`.
  Reflexive/symmetric/idempotent (`hrefl`/`hsym`/`hidem`) come from `ERel_equivalence`
  through `quotLe_iff_algLe`, `qRecip_mk`, `qComp_mk`.
* A hypothetical map-splitting `f` of `eE` in `Rel(R)` is, by fullness of the graph
  embedding (`embedRel_full`, §2.148), the graph of a recursive map `g`; then
  `f ≫ f° = eE` says `g ⊚ g° ≈ ERel` and `f° ≫ f = 1` says `g` is a cover
  (`cover_iff_one_le_reciprocal_comp_self`, §1.569) — i.e. exactly `IsEffective ERel`,
  contradicting `ERel_not_effective`.  Hence no such splitting exists (`no_splitsAsMap`),
  and the general theorem yields non-AC-ness of the reflection.

Mathlib-free; diagram-order composition `R ≫ S`; relation composition `⊚`.
