    This is the *substantive content* of §1.568/§1.951 once the quotient cover is
    available: it packages `E ≅ level x ≅ (graph x) ⊚ (graph x)°` using the two
    bridges above, producing the `IsEffective` data (`Q`, `x`, `Cover x`, and the
    mutual relational containments with `(graph x) ⊚ (graph x)°`).  No `sorry`. -/

end Effective

/-- **§1.951**: A topos is effective: every equivalence relation on any object is
    the level of some cover (i.e., is effective in the sense of §1.568).

    Freyd's route (the power-object construction): an equivalence relation
    `E ⊆ A×A` is tabulated; the quotient `A/E` is obtained as the image of the
    classifying / characteristic map `A → Ω^A` (singleton `Δ₁` composed with the
    quotient that names `E`-classes), and `q : A ↠ A/E` is a cover whose level
    (kernel pair) is exactly `E`.  Granting that quotient cover,
    `effective_of_quotient_cover` discharges effectiveness completely.

    **Sharpened blocker (faithful sorry).**  Building the `EffectiveRegular`
    instance from bare `[Topos 𝒞]` needs THREE ingredients, of which only the
    last is genuinely absent here:

      (1) `HasImages 𝒞` — NOT derivable from `Topos` in this repo.  The only topos
          construction of `image f` is `⋂{B' ↣ B | f factors through B'}`
          (§1.943), the glb over a subobject *family*, which rests on §1.54's
          `capitalization_lemma` (still `sorry`; see `topos_is_regular`,
          S1_94:321).

      (2) `PullbacksTransferCovers 𝒞` — topos exactness; likewise reducible to the
          §1.54 / image machinery (cf. `regular_of_compose_assoc`, S1_56:1255).

      (3) THE QUOTIENT COVER — for each equivalence relation `E`, a cover
          `q : A ↠ A/E` with `level q ≅ E`.  This is Freyd's power-object
          construction `A → Ω^A` and needs the power object `Ω^A = exp A Ω`,
          which is opaque here because `topos_has_exponentials` (S1_92) is itself
          an unfilled `sorry` (blocked on §1.543 capitalization).

    Once (1)–(3) are available, this instance is
    `⟨…, fun E hE => effective_of_quotient_cover E hE q hq hElq hlqE⟩`
    with `(q, hq, hElq, hlqE)` the quotient cover from (3).  The recovery half (the
    relation-algebra identity `E ≅ level q ≅ (graph q)⊚(graph q)°`) is now PROVED
    above (`effective_of_quotient_cover`), so the residual gap is exactly the
    quotient-cover existence (3) on top of the §1.54-blocked (1)–(2). -/

/-! ## §1.952  A topos is positive -/

/-- **§1.952**: A topos is positive: it has binary coproducts A + B.
    Proof sketch (Freyd): For any A, ΔR factors through ΔA1 iff R is a map,
    and through Δ0 iff R = 0.  So A + 1 exists.  Then A + B is constructed
    as a subobject of [A] × [B] = [A + B]. -/

section Coequalizers
variable [HasTerminal 𝒞] [HasBinaryProducts 𝒞] [HasPullbacks 𝒞] [HasImages 𝒞]

/-! The §1.77↔§1.56 equivalence-relation bridge `equivalenceRelation_of_isEquivRel`
    and the §1.954 core reduction `minEquiv_of_rtc` (every endo-relation has a minimal
    equivalence relation containing it, via the closure `(R ∪ R° ∪ 1)*`) live canonically
    in `Fredy.S1_64` (lower in the import hierarchy); reused here via import (DRY). -/

end Coequalizers

/-- **§1.954, substantive reduction (no `sorry`)**: a PRE-TOPOS that has
    reflexive-transitive closures has coequalizers.

    Construction: from `[HasReflTransClosure 𝒞]`, `minEquiv_of_rtc` gives
    `HasMinEquivContaining` (the equivalence closure `(R ∪ R° ∪ 1)*` is the minimal
    equivalence containing `R`); then `preTopos_minEquiv_to_cocartesian` (§1.657)
    builds coequalizers via the *effective-regular* route — the minimal equivalence
    `S` containing `R = «f,g»` is the level of a cover `q : B ↠ C` (effectiveness,
    §1.951), and `q` is the coequalizer of `f, g`.  No `sorry`. -/

/-- **§1.954**: A topos has coequalizers.
    Given f, g : A → B, let R = f"g, S = (R ∪ R")* (the equivalence closure).
    A topos is effective [1.951], so S is the level of some B → C.
    This B → C is the coequalizer of f and g.

    The *substantive content* is fully discharged in `preTopos_rtc_has_coequalizers`
    (no `sorry`): once `[PreTopos 𝒞]` (= effective-regular + positive pre-logos) and
    `[HasReflTransClosure 𝒞]` are available, the equivalence-closure construction
    `(R ∪ R° ∪ 1)*` (now constructive via `rtc`) plus §1.657/§1.951 yield
    coequalizers.

    **Sharpened blocker (faithful sorry).**  Synthesising the instance from bare
    `[Topos 𝒞]` needs two things this repo cannot yet provide from `Topos`:

      (1) `PreTopos 𝒞` — in particular `EffectiveRegular 𝒞` (and the underlying
          `RegularCategory`/`HasImages`/`PullbacksTransferCovers`).  This is
          `topos_is_effective` (line 161), still a `sorry` blocked on the §1.54
          capitalization lemma (the topos image construction
          `⋂{B' ↣ B | f ↦ B'}` rests on `capitalization_lemma`, S1_94:321).

      (2) `HasReflTransClosure 𝒞` — there is NO `topos_has_rtc` instance: a topos's
          reflexive-transitive closures are themselves obtained by the §1.543
          transfinite (capitalization) colimit, the same blocker as (1).

    `rtc` being now available means the *equivalence-closure* sub-problem is no
    longer the gap: the residual blocker is exactly the existence of `rtc`
    *instances* on a topos (2) on top of the §1.54-blocked effectiveness (1).  With
    both, this instance is literally `preTopos_rtc_has_coequalizers`. -/

    its composite `m ≫ f : S ↣ B` to obtain `h : B → Ω`.  Because `f` is monic the
    pullback of the subobject `m ≫ f` along `f` is `m` itself, so `f ≫ h` classifies
    `m`; by uniqueness of characteristic maps `f ≫ h = g`.  (This is the elementary
    form of "Ω is injective": maps into Ω extend along monics via `classify`.) -/

/-- **§1.961**: In a topos, Ω is internally injective.

    Freyd's proof: for monic `f : A ↣ B`, the contravariant action `Ω^f` is the
    inverse-image `[f"]` (post-composition by the reciprocal `f°`), and it has a
    LEFT INVERSE — the covariant direct image `[f] = powerMapCov f` — because `f`
    monic is equivalent to `f"f = 1` (`powerMapCov`'s defining identity).  A split
    epi is a cover, so `Ω^f` is a cover.

    **Sharpened blocker (faithful sorry).**  The section needed is exactly
    `powerMapCov f : Ω^A → Ω^B` (the direct-image action), which is an unfilled
    `sorry` in §1.92: it requires the §1.56 image factorization packaged as a
    power-object morphism together with the membership/Λ universal property of the

/-- **§1.964**: In a value-based topos, Ω is a cogenerator: for any f ≠ g : A → B,
    there exists h : B → Ω such that f ≫ h ≠ g ≫ h.

    Freyd's route is `(−, Ω) = χ?(−)` plus `B' = Im(xf)` for a subterminator value
    `x : U → A` with `xf ≠ xg`.  Under this repo's *bare* `[Topos 𝒞]` that route is
    not directly available (it needs `HasImages` / image-of-`xf`, both blocked on the
    §1.54 capitalization lemma; cf. `topos_is_effective`).  We give an equivalent
    proof needing only the classifier:

    A value `x : U → A` out of a subterminator `U` (`Mono (term U)`) makes ANY map out
    of `U` monic — any two maps INTO `U` agree (`term`-uniqueness + `term U` monic).  So
    `x ≫ f : U ↣ B` is itself monic; take `h := χ(x ≫ f)`.  Then `(x≫f)≫h = term≫true`,
    and the no-separation hypothesis forces `(x≫g)≫h = term≫true` too.  `monic_is_equalizer`
    (§1.913) factors `x≫g = k ≫ (x≫f)` with `k : U → U`; subterminal collapse gives `k = id`,
    so `x≫g = x≫f`.  This holds for every subterminator value, so `IsValueBased` forces
    `f = g`, contradicting `f ≠ g`.  (Sorry-free; axioms: propext, choice, Quot.sound.) -/

/-- **§1.969**: The LAWVERE DEFINITION of a Grothendieck topos:
    a cocomplete topos with a generating set.
    (By §1.967 copowers of 1 give all copowers, hence all coproducts,
     so with a generating set one recovers the Giraud axioms.) -/
class LawvereGrothendieckTopos (𝒞 : Type u) [Cat.{v} 𝒞] extends Topos 𝒞 where
  /-- Arbitrary coproducts exist. -/
  cocomplete : Cocomplete 𝒞
  /-- A small generating set. -/
  gen_set : 𝒞 → Prop
  has_gen_set : IsGeneratingSet gen_set

/-- **§1.969**: The TIERNEY DEFINITION of a Grothendieck topos:
    a topos with a progenitor and arbitrary copowers of 1.
    (The copowers-of-1 condition is equivalent to having a geometric morphism to Set.) -/
class TierneyGrothendieckTopos (𝒞 : Type u) [Cat.{v} 𝒞] extends Topos 𝒞,
    HasBinaryCoproducts 𝒞 where
  /-- A progenitor exists. -/
  progenitor : 𝒞
  is_progenitor : IsProgenitor progenitor
  /-- Arbitrary copowers of 1 exist. -/
  copow_one : (I : Type v) → ∃ (cI : 𝒞) (inj : I → one ⟶ cI),
    ∀ {X : 𝒞} (f : I → one ⟶ X), ∃ (h : cI ⟶ X), (∀ i, inj i ≫ h = f i)

/-- **§1.969**: The Lawvere and Tierney definitions yield the same notion.
    Given the Tierney definition, use §1.966 to get Ω^G as cogenerator,
    then §1.967 (c)→(a) to get arbitrary powers, then the coproduct construction
    in the proof of §1.968. -/
