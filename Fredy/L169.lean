  LeetCode 169 — Majority Element — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM (Boyer–Moore voting).

  Problem: given `nums` in which some value occurs STRICTLY more than `⌊n/2⌋` times (LeetCode
  guarantees such a value exists), return it. The classic O(n) O(1)-space solution is the
  Boyer–Moore voting algorithm.

  Recipe (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S0): data is a plain `List Int` (as in `L56`/`L242`, no `SnocList`
  engine needed — the accumulator-fold shape is exactly `List.foldl`, which is structural/`rfl`-
  transparent, `Init/Data/List/Basic.lean`'s `List.foldl_cons`).

  1. **Program (the voting fold).** State `(cand : Int, cnt : Nat)`; for each `x`: if `cnt = 0`,
     start a new candidacy `(x, 1)`; else if `x = cand`, increment; else decrement (a "cancelling"
     vote). `majorityFn nums := (nums.foldl step (0,0)).1`.

  2. **Specification — honest, not a tautology.** `IsMajority nums v := 2 * countL nums v >
     nums.length` (`countL` reused from `Fredy.L242`, DRY) — `v` occurs strictly more than half the
     time. **Headline**: `majority_correct : IsMajority nums v → majorityFn nums = v`. (A strict
     majority is unique, so this pins `majorityFn` exactly whenever one exists; `majorityFn` is
     still total — on inputs with NO majority it returns some value, just not necessarily a useful
     one — so there is deliberately no `solve = spec`, cf. `L1`'s S34 note.)

  3. **The real content — the Boyer–Moore invariant.** `BMInv xs c k` says: after voting on the
     PROCESSED prefix `xs` (ending in state `(c,k)`), for every value `w`: if `w = c` then
     `2 * countL xs w ≤ xs.length + k`, and if `w ≠ c` then `2 * countL xs w + k ≤ xs.length`
     (phrased with `+k` on the LARGER side throughout, so it needs no `Nat` subtraction anywhere —
     only `step`'s own `cnt - 1` does, and only ever at `cnt ≠ 0`, i.e. a genuine positive
     predecessor). It is proved by a one-step lemma `step_inv` (extending the invariant across one
     `step`, by cases on `k = 0` / `x = c`, each closed by `omega` given a `countL`-of-snoc unfold)
     assembled over the whole list by `bmInv_gen` (generalizing over an arbitrary starting `(c,k)`
     already `BMInv`-compatible with a "processed so far" prefix — induction on the NEW suffix,
     peeling its head via `List.foldl_cons`, feeding the one-step lemma into the IH one element at
     a time). Dropping the `k ≥ 0` slack from the `w ≠ c` case gives exactly "any non-candidate
     appears at most half the time" (`noncand_le_half`), which is the whole proof of
     `majority_correct` by a two-way `by_cases` (this repo has no mathlib `by_contra`, S48).

  Mathlib-free. Axioms target `⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}` — the whole proof is `List` structural
  induction + `omega`, no `Classical.choice` anywhere (no `∃`/non-`False` goal is ever closed by
  `omega`/`simp` straight from a numeric contradiction, S33/S3).
