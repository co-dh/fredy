  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.157 — the PAYOFF (p. 15):
  a concrete NON-DESARGUESIAN projective plane, hence a finitely-presented one-object
  allegory violating the Desargues Horn sentence that `Rel(S)` satisfies.

  The plane is the translation plane over the Veblen–Wedderburn RIGHT NEAR-FIELD `J₉`
  of order 9 (Veblen–Wedderburn 1907; the Hall plane of order 9).  `J₉` is `GF(9)`
  with its addition, but multiplication twisted through the Frobenius (Dickson's
  construction): `x ∘ y = x·y` when `y` is a square in `GF(9)`, `x³·y` when not.
  All near-field laws hold EXCEPT left distributivity — and that failure propagates
  to a concrete ten-point Desargues violation in the plane built from it.

  Formalised here:
  · `VW.add`/`VW.neg`/`VW.mul` — `J₉` as `Fin 9` (element `a + 3b` codes `a + b·i`,
    `i² = -1` in `GF(9) = 𝔽₃[i]`) with EXPLICIT 9×9 operation tables; the near-field
    laws (abelian group `+`, two-sided unit, associativity of `∘`, RIGHT
    distributivity, no zero divisors, left/right solvability) all by kernel `decide`,
    plus `not_left_distrib` — the twist is genuine.
  · `VW : ProjectivePlane` — points `(J₉ × J₉) ⊕ J₉ ⊕ Unit` (affine, slope,
    vertical direction `∞`), lines `(J₉ × J₉) ⊕ J₉ ⊕ Unit` (`y = x∘m + b` coded
    `(m,b)`, verticals `x = c`, the line at infinity); the three plane axioms by
    symbolic case analysis over the near-field laws.  `VW_interesting`.
  · `VW_not_desargues` — THE CORE: a concrete violating ten-point configuration
    (found by random search over the coded coordinates, verified here by `decide`).
  · `VW_not_desarguesHorn` — via §2.157g `desarguesND_iff_desarguesHorn`: the
    associated one-object allegory `LMonObj (PElem VW)` violates the Desargues
    Horn sentence.

  Elements are `Fin 9`; the index `a + 3b` (`a, b ∈ {0,1,2}`) codes `a + b·i ∈ GF(9)`,
  where `i² = -1` (so `0..2 = 0,1,2`, `3 = i`, `4 = 1+i`, `5 = 2+i`, `6 = 2i`,
  `7 = 1+2i`, `8 = 2+2i`).  The nonzero squares of `GF(9)` are `{1, 2, i, 2i}` =
  indices `{1, 2, 3, 6}`; the Frobenius `x ↦ x³` is conjugation `a + bi ↦ a - bi`. -/

/-! ### The geometric solvability lemmas (kernel `decide`, ≤ 9⁴·9 lookups)

  Only RIGHT distributivity is available, so the two affine existence problems are
  genuinely one-sided:
  · JOIN of `(x₁,y₁)`, `(x₂,y₂)` with `x₁ ≠ x₂`: the slope `m` solves
    `(x₁ - x₂)∘m = y₁ - y₂` (left solvability); with `b := y₁ - x₁∘m` both
    incidences hold.
  · MEET of `(m₁,b₁)`, `(m₂,b₂)` with `m₁ ≠ m₂`: `x ↦ x∘m₁ - x∘m₂` is additive
    (RIGHT distributivity) with trivial kernel (left cancellation), hence bijective;
    solve `x∘m₁ - x∘m₂ = b₂ - b₁`. -/

/-- `v + (u - v) = u` — the additive rearrangement used to check incidences. -/
theorem sub_add_cancel : ∀ u v : J9, add v (sub u v) = u := by decide

/-- JOIN solvability, packaged in incidence shape: for `x₁ ≠ x₂` there is a slope
    `m` putting `(x₂,y₂)` on the line through `(x₁,y₁)` of slope `m`. -/
theorem join_slope_exists : ∀ x₁ y₁ x₂ y₂ : J9, x₁ ≠ x₂ →
    ∃ m, y₂ = add (mul x₂ m) (sub y₁ (mul x₁ m)) := by decide

/-- MEET solvability: two line codes of distinct slopes agree at some abscissa. -/
theorem meet_mb_exists : ∀ m₁ b₁ m₂ b₂ : J9, m₁ ≠ m₂ →
    ∃ x, add (mul x m₁) b₁ = add (mul x m₂) b₂ := by decide

/-- Additive cancellation, for uniqueness of the `b`-code. -/
theorem add_left_cancel : ∀ v b₁ b₂ : J9, add v b₁ = add v b₂ → b₁ = b₂ := by decide

theorem cross_sub : ∀ X₁ b₁ X₂ b₂ : J9, add X₁ b₁ = add X₂ b₂ →
    sub X₁ X₂ = sub b₂ b₁ := by decide

/-- For `m₁ ≠ m₂` the map `x ↦ x∘m₁ - x∘m₂` is INJECTIVE — two lines of distinct
    slopes meet in at most one affine point. -/

/-! ### The three projective-plane axioms -/

/-- AXIOM 1: any two points lie on a common line.  Affine–affine splits on
    `x₁ = x₂` (vertical) vs. `x₁ ≠ x₂` (`join_slope_exists`); a slope point rides
    every line of its slope; ideal points join along the line at infinity. -/

/-- AXIOM 2: any two lines meet.  Same slope meets at the slope's ideal point;
    distinct slopes meet affinely (`meet_mb_exists`); a slope line meets a vertical
    at the obvious affine point; verticals and the line at infinity share `∞`. -/

/-- AXIOM 3: two points on two common lines force equal points or equal lines.
    After the constructor split, all mixed-sort cases die on a `False` incidence or
    close by transitivity; the one substantive case — two affine points on two
    slope-coded lines — is `slope_inj` (distinct slopes meet in ≤ 1 affine point)
    plus `add_left_cancel` (same slope forces the same `b`-code). -/

  The triangles are in perspective from `p`, all nine premises of `DesarguesND`
  hold — yet `u`, `v`, `w` are NOT colinear: the line through `u = (0,6)` and
  `v = (1,0)` is `y = x∘3 + 6`, and `w = (5,0)` misses it (`5∘3 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 5 ≠ 0`).
  Left distributivity fails in exactly the right place. -/

/-- The meets `u = (0,6)`, `v = (1,0)`, `w = (5,0)` of corresponding sides are NOT
    colinear: slope-coded lines force `b = 6`, `m = 3` from `u`, `v`, but then `w`
    misses; the abscissae `0, 1` rule out verticals; affine points miss infinity. -/

/-! ## §2.157h  The Horn-sentence payoff (p. 15)

  Freyd's point in §2.157: the Desargues Horn sentence "is easily verified for
  Rel(S)" (`desarguesHorn_binRel`), yet here is a finite one-object allegory —
  the modular lattice 𝓛(VW) of the Veblen–Wedderburn plane, viewed through
  §2.156/§2.113 — that VIOLATES it.  Horn sentences do not axiomatise the
  representable allegories, and (p. 15) "the theory of allegories in which
  Desargues's theorem is false" is consistent. -/

/-- **§2.157 payoff: the allegory of the Veblen–Wedderburn plane violates the
    Desargues Horn sentence** — immediately from the §2.157g equivalence
    `desarguesND_iff_desarguesHorn` and `VW_not_desargues`. -/
theorem VW_not_desarguesHorn : ¬ DesarguesHorn (LMonObj (PElem VW)) :=
  fun h => VW_not_desargues (desarguesND_iff_desarguesHorn.mpr h)

/-! ### Gap analysis: the non-representability corollary

  The intended p. 15 consequence — `LMonObj (PElem VW)` admits NO faithful
  representation in `Rel(Set)` (nor in any power of it) — needs two transfer
  facts not yet in the repo, so it is NOT stated here:

  1. `DesarguesHorn (RelObj (Type u))`: the Horn sentence for the honest
     `Allegory` instance on `RelObj` (§2.154).  The element chase is DONE
     (`desarguesHorn_binRel`, §2.157); missing is only the wiring through
     `RelObj`'s `≫`/`∩`/`°`/`⊑` definitions.
  2. Horn reflection: for a faithful `F : AllegoryFunctor 𝒜 ℬ` (§2.148),
     `DesarguesHorn ℬ → DesarguesHorn 𝒜` — `F` preserves `≫`/`°`/`∩` by its
     fields, and faithful + `map_inter` reflects `⊑` (`R ⊑ S ↔ R ∩ S = R`).

  Both are routine; together with `VW_not_desarguesHorn` they would give
  `¬ ∃ F : AllegoryFunctor (LMonObj (PElem VW)) (RelObj (Type u)), F.Faithful`. -/
