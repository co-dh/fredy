/-! # §1.543 C — the §1.547 slice equivalence interface, and the precise well-pointedness gap

  This file packages the §1.547 factor-slice bridge `Â → Σ U, A/(∏U)` (committed Sorry-free in
  `RationalCapitalization.lean` as `pairHomToSlice`/`pairHomOfSlice`/`pairSliceObj`) into a clean
  **two-sided equivalence interface** at a FIXED base, and uses it to pin the EXACT remaining gap of
  Freyd's §1.543 capitalization endgame: well-pointedness of the structured slice.

  ## What this file establishes (all Sorry-free; the residual is NAMED, never faked)

  Route assessment (Step 0 of the brief), then the reusable interface.

  ### Route decision: NEITHER route closes §1.543 — both reduce to the SAME single open fact

  The brief proposes Route 1 (direct `listDirected` colimit of structured slices) and Route 2 (via
  `A* = pairRatCat`).  After reading the committed infrastructure, the determination is:

  * **`pairRatCat` / `pairPreRegular` are NOT Sorry-free.**  `PreRegularCategory (PairObj 𝒞)`
    (`pairPreRegular`) rests on `pairPullbacksTransferCovers`, which is a genuine `Sorry`
    (`RationalCapitalization.lean:3080`).  So Route 2's *first* premise ("`A*` is pre-regular") is
    itself open, and Route 1's structured-slice transitions (the `PairObj`-pullbacks
    `pairHasPullbacks`) feed the same cover-transfer obligation.

  * **The well-pointedness obligation is ONE fact, identical in both routes.**  Both routes must
    discharge: a *proper* mono into the structured embedded object `sliceEmbedObj (∏U) A` is missed
    by some point.  R15 (`prodFormMono_misses_point`, Sorry-free, axiom-free) escapes any
    **product-form** proper mono `id_A × (i : B'↪P)`.  The gap is the reduction "arbitrary proper
    mono ⟹ product form", which `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` (`RationalCapitalization.lean:4544`)
    leaves as its lone `Sorry`, with the long note explaining WHY it is not elementary in the plain
    slice and `graph_satisfies_hyps` proving the naive "generic point escapes" is FALSE.

  * **`PairDense` does NOT supply the reduction.**  `PairDense` is the class of *dense* maps (covers
    / epis: `pairDense_cover`/`pairDense_epi`); the well-pointedness obligation is about proper
    *monos* (the opposite extreme).  There is NO committed theorem "proper `Â`-mono ⟹ product form",
    and the file headers (`StepWellPointed.lean`, the `sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed` note) record
    this as the genuine open content of §1.546/547.  Hence the brief's premise "subobjects in the
    `A*` layer are product-form" is the unproven goal, not an available lemma.

  CONCLUSION.  The cleanest Sorry-free deliverable is the slice-equivalence INTERFACE itself
  (the bridge, packaged as a fixed-base equivalence) plus the EXACT reduction of structured-slice
  well-pointedness to the product-form escape, so the single missing fact is isolated as a named
  hypothesis (`ProperMonoIsProductForm`) and everything around it is machine-checked.

  ### The committed interface

  * `SliceBridge` — the fixed-base, two-sided bridge: at base `∏Y°`, `pairHomToSlice`/`pairHomOfSlice`
    are mutually inverse on underlying arrows (a `PairHom X → Y` is THE SAME DATA as a slice map
    `reindexObj (listProdRestrict X° Y°) (pairSliceObj X) → pairSliceObj Y`).
  * `bridge_roundtrip_g` / `bridge_roundtrip_f` — the round-trips, Sorry-free.
  * `ProperMonoIsProductForm` — the single missing §1.547 fact, named as a `Prop` over a base.
  * `wellPointed_of_productForm` — GIVEN `ProperMonoIsProductForm`, the structured embedded object is
    `WellPointed` (the R15 escape applied uniformly).  This is the Sorry-free reduction; the only
    open input is the named hypothesis, exactly Freyd's §1.546 reduction. -/

  At the codomain base `∏Y.targets`, `pairHomToSlice` and `pairHomOfSlice` are inverse bijections on

    applied to `pairHomToSlice m` recovers a `PairHom` with the SAME underlying `.g` as `m`.  Since a

    map `φ` over `∏Y°` from the reindexed `pairSliceObj X` to `pairSliceObj Y`, `pairHomToSlice` of
    `pairHomOfSlice hsub φ` has the SAME underlying `.f = φ.f`.  (Equality as `OverHom`s then follows
    from `OverHom.ext`, the slice-hom extensionality.) -/

/-! ## The well-pointedness reduction: from product-form to the R15 escape

  This is the genuine §1.546/547 content, isolated so the single missing fact is a NAMED
  hypothesis and the escape around it is machine-checked.  Freyd's §1.546 escape
  (`prodFormMono_misses_point`, Sorry-free, axiom-free) handles any *product-form* proper mono
  `id_A × (i : B'↪P)`.  The open content (`sliceEmbed_factor_wellPointed`'s `Sorry`) is the
  reduction of an *arbitrary* proper mono to product form.  We name exactly that reduction as
  `ProperMonoIsProductForm` and prove the well-pointedness payoff from it Sorry-free. -/

    a slice iso `e : D ≅ ⟨A×B', snd≫i⟩` with `e ≫ prodFormMono i = m`.  This is Freyd's §1.546
    reduction — "every subobject of `AB` is of the form `AB'`" — which is NOT elementary in the plain
    slice (`graph_satisfies_hyps` refutes the naive form; the genuine reduction lives in the
    localization layer).  Naming it makes the well-pointedness payoff machine-checkable. -/

    `i : B' ↪ P` proper; `prodFormMono_misses_slicePoint` gives a g-point missed by `prodFormMono i`;

/-! ## §1.546 — the DETERMINATION: `ProperMonoIsProductForm` as stated is FALSE; the genuine
    relative-cap content is product-form well-pointedness (Sorry-free, this section)

  `ProperMonoIsProductForm P A` (above) asks that EVERY proper *plain-slice* mono into
  `sliceEmbedObj P A` be product-form.  That is not merely hard — it is **provably false**, by two
  independent Sorry-free witnesses imported here:

  * `properMono_forces_graph_iso` — the "graph of the generic point" (`graph_satisfies_hyps`,
    `RationalCapitalization.lean`) is a proper plain-slice mono that is NOT product-form: assuming
    `ProperMonoIsProductForm` forces it to be a slice-iso, i.e. forces
    `IsIso (pair (proj_k) id)`, which fails whenever the factor `U.get k` is not `≅ 1`.
  * `properMono_one_forces_wellPointed` — at base `P = 1`, `ProperMonoIsProductForm 1 A` together
    with any point `g : 1 → A` gives, via `wellPointed_of_productForm` then `factorWP_imp_wp`
    (`SliceWellPointed.lean`, Sorry-free), that `A` is `WellPointed` *downstairs*.  Since
    `WellSupported A` does NOT imply `WellPointed A` in a non-`Capital` category, the hypothesis
    cannot hold in general — it would presuppose the very capitalization it is meant to build.

  CONCLUSION.  `wellPointed_of_productForm`'s hypothesis is unprovable; chasing it is a dead end.
  Freyd's §1.546 never asks for it.  The relative-capitalization step (§1.545,
  `IsRelativeCapitalization`) only ranges over *downstairs* proper subobjects `i : B' ↪ P`, whose
  slice image is the PRODUCT-FORM mono `prodFormMono i` — and THAT is missed by every point
  (`prodFormMono_misses_slicePoint`, Sorry-free).  The corrected, true, and sufficient statement is
  therefore "every *proper product-form* mono misses a point", built Sorry-free below as
  `prodFormMono_wellPointed`.  Its properness ingredient is exactly Freyd's §1.472 specialness
  (`IsSpecial`) — properness of `id_A × i` from properness of `i` is FALSE without specialness
  (§1.475 Z-sets, recorded at `prodEndo_faithful_of_embedding`), so `IsSpecial` is the honest,
  load-bearing hypothesis, not a fake. -/

/-- **`ProperMonoIsProductForm` is FALSE — witness 1 (the graph).**  If
    `ProperMonoIsProductForm (∏U) (U.get k)` held, the proper plain-slice mono
    `graph_satisfies_hyps U k` (underlying `pair (proj_k) id`) — which is NOT product-form — would be
    forced to be a slice-iso, i.e. `pair (listProdProj U k) (id)` would be iso.  This fails for any
    factor `U.get k` not isomorphic to `1`, refuting the hypothesis.  (A product-form decomposition
    `e ⊚ prodFormMono i = m` with `e` iso would give `e.f ≫ snd` a section of `i`, forcing the proper
    base mono `i` to be iso — the contradiction inside the proof.) -/

  Freyd's §1.546 missed-point argument concerns only PRODUCT-FORM subobjects `id_A × i` (the slice
  images of downstairs proper monos `i : B' ↪ P`).  For those, well-pointedness is fully provable.
  Properness of `id_A × i` from properness of `i` is the §1.472 specialness content (`IsSpecial`),
  honest and load-bearing; monicity and the missed-point are the Sorry-free
  `prodFormMono_mono` / `prodFormMono_misses_slicePoint`. -/

section ProductForm

/-- The §1.472 specialness condition, phrased directly over the in-scope products (avoiding the
    `CartesianCategory` instance-coherence clash of `IsSpecial`): the right-hand product `m × id_B`

    factor `A`, the product-form slice mono `prodFormMono i` is not a slice-iso.  Its underlying arrow
    is `id_A × i = (prodEndo A).map i`; `isIso_prod_mono_iff` swaps that to `i × id_A`, whose
    properness is exactly the specialness instance at `(i, j)`.  NOTE properness here is NOT free —

/-! ## §1.547 — the FIXED-`U` slice equivalence `A*|U ≃ A/(∏U)`

  Freyd (§1.547, lines 4958-4961): for a finite list `U` of well-supported objects, `A*|U` is the
  full subcategory of the rational category `A*` on objects `(A,F)` with `F° ⊆ U`, and it is
  EQUIVALENT to the slice `A/(∏U) = Over (listProd U)`.  This is the FIXED-base equivalence — NO
  colimit; the directed union `A* = ⋃_U A*|U` comes later.

  ### The design (chosen given this repo's vocabulary)

  The repo has NO bundled `Equivalence` record; its functor-equivalence notion is
  `EquivalenceFunctor F := Embedding F ∧ Full F ∧ HasRepresentativeImage F` (S1_31), i.e. fully
  faithful + essentially surjective.  So we express `A*|U ≃ A/(∏U)` as an `EquivalenceFunctor`.

  Freyd's `F° ⊆ U` subcategory has objects sitting over DIFFERENT bases `∏(F°)`, so the object map
  into the single slice `Over (∏U)` is not literal.  We follow Freyd's own padding: work with the
  full subcategory `PairOnU U` on objects whose targets are EXACTLY `U` (in order), where every
  object sits over the common base `∏U` and `pairSliceObj` is an HONEST object map into `Over(∏U)`.
  The bridge (`pairHomToSlice`/`pairHomOfSlice`, Sorry-free in `RationalCapitalization.lean`) makes
  the resulting functor fully faithful; representative-image is the slice→pair construction (every
  `⟨A,h:A→∏U⟩` is `pairSliceObj` of the padded `(A, {h ≫ proj_k})`).  The padding `A*|U ≃ PairOnU U`
  (every `F° ⊆ U` is iso to one with `F'° = U`) is the remaining inclusion; the equivalence
  `PairOnU U ≃ A/(∏U)` is what is built Sorry-free below.

  Morphisms of `PairOnU U` are plain `PairHom`s (the subcategory is FULL), so the category structure
  is inherited from `pairsCat`. -/

  Every slice object `⟨A, h : A → ∏U⟩` is `pairOnUSlice` of a padded pair `(A, F)` with `F° = U`:
  take `F` to record, for each coordinate of `∏U`, the component `h ≫ projₖ` of `h`.  Built by
  recursion on `U` (decomposing `∏(T::U) = T × ∏U` via `fst`/`snd`), so `F° = U` definitionally and
  `factorTuple F = h` by `pair_eta`.  Well-supportedness of the factors needs each `T ∈ U` well
  supported; the `distinct` field needs `U` to have NO repeated target (`U.Nodup`) — otherwise two
  coordinates of `∏U` with the same target carry the (possibly different) components `h ≫ projₖ`,
  which `PairObj.distinct` would force equal.  (For a SET `U` of well-supported objects, exactly
  Freyd's hypothesis, both hold.) -/
