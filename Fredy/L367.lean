  LeetCode 367 — Valid Perfect Square — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given `n : ℕ`, decide whether `n` is a perfect square, i.e. whether `∃ k, k*k = n`.

  A DECISION problem (`Bool` answer), same shape as `Fredy.L217` (Contains Duplicate): the
  program is a `Bool` function, the spec is a `Prop`, and correctness is a plain `iff`, not an
  extremum. Unlike `L217`/`L121` the input is not a list/`SnocList` — it is a single `ℕ`, so (as
  in `Fredy.L70`) the object is plain `dNat`.

  1. **Program** — `sqFuel fuel k n` searches upward from `k`, testing `k*k = n`, `k*k > n`
     (fail), else recursing to `k+1` with one less fuel unit. FUEL (`leetcode.md` S13) rather than
     well-founded recursion on `n - k*k`, so the definition stays kernel-reducible (`decide`-
     friendly). `isPerfectSquareFn n := sqFuel (n+1) 0 n` — starting the search AT `k = 0` (not
     `k = 1`) means `n = 0` needs no special case (`0*0 = 0`): no `if n = 0` branch anywhere in
     the program or the proof (CLAUDE.md "normalize outliers, don't special-case them").

  2. **Spec** — `n` is a perfect square iff `∃ k, k*k = n` — the textbook definition, taken
     directly as the honest spec (no auxiliary bound smuggled in).

  3. **Correctness** (`perfectSquare_correct`) — reflection bridge (S5): `isPerfectSquareFn n =
     true ↔ ∃ k, k*k = n`.
     - Soundness (→, `sqFuel_sound`) — induction on the fuel: a `true` only ever comes from the
       `k*k = n` branch, which hands back `k` as the witness.
     - Completeness (←, `sqFuel_complete`) — the crux: an invariant that GENERALIZES over the
       search's current position `j`: if a witness `k0` with `j ≤ k0 ≤ j + fuel` exists, then
       `sqFuel fuel j n = true`. Proved by induction on `fuel`, using `k*k`'s monotonicity
       (`Nat.mul_le_mul`) to rule out the `j*j > n` branch (no witness `≥ j` could then exist) and
       to show a witness surviving the `j*j ≠ n` branch is `≥ j+1`, hence still reachable with one
       less fuel unit from `j+1`.
     - Fuel sufficiency: any witness `k0` satisfies `k0 ≤ n` (`Nat.le_mul_of_pos_right` when
       `k0 ≥ 1`; trivial when `k0 = 0`), so `k0 ≤ 0 + (n+1)`.
