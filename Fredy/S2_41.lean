  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.414  (forward direction).

  §2.414  "If A is an object in a topos C, let ∋ ⊆ [A]×A be its universal relation.
           The uniqueness condition in the definition of universal relations forces ∋
           to be straight [1.9].  Using the last section [§2.413] we may infer the
           thickness condition."

  We build `relPowerAllegory : PowerAllegory (RelObj 𝒞)` for a logos `𝒞` whose objects
  have power objects (the two ingredients a topos supplies: a logos is a division
  allegory `relDivisionAllegory` (§1.784/§2.32), and each `[C]` carries the universal
  relation `∈_C` (§1.9)).  The membership relation `∈_C : [C] → C`, read as a `Rel(C)`
  morphism, is the epsilon `∋_C`.

  * `eps ⟨b⟩ = [∈_b]`           — the universal relation as a `Rel(C)` morphism.
  * `eps_thick`                 — Freyd's §2.413 thickness: the transpose `Λ(R)` (a map)
                                  satisfies `Λ(R) ≫ ∋ = R` (discharged for EVERY `R`,
                                  the box guard ignored, strictly stronger than the field
                                  asks — exactly the §2.434 `globalScPrePower` pattern).
  * `eps_straight`              — Freyd's "uniqueness forces ∋ straight": from the
                                  uniqueness of classifying maps (`univHomExt923`) every
                                  symmetric congruence `T ⊚ ∈ = ∈` is the diagonal.

  Hypotheses are `[Logos 𝒞] [∀ C : 𝒞, HasPowerObject C]` rather than `[Topos 𝒞]`: this is
  the minimal honest combination (division allegory + power objects), and it shares the
  SINGLE ambient `HasPullbacks` of the logos, sidestepping the `Topos`/`Logos`
  HasPullbacks instance diamond — exactly as `Baseable923` deliberately does.

/-! ## §2.414  The relational pullback is a `Rel(C)` composite

  Freyd writes `fU` for "the pullback of `U` along `f`" (§1.9).  In `Rel(C)` that is the
  composite `[graph f] ⊚ U`.  This bridge identifies the two, letting the §1.9 universal
  property (stated with `relPullback`) drive the allegory-level `∋` laws. -/

    ≅ graph f ⊚ U`, using `relPullback_compose_dist` (distribution over `⊚`) and
    `relPullback_graph_id` (`graph f ≅ relPullback f (graph 1)`). -/

/-! ## §2.413 / §2.414  Thickness of `∋`

  Freyd: "Using the last section [§2.413] we may infer the thickness condition."  For
  every relation `R₀ : c → b`, the transpose `Λ(R₀) : c → [b]` (the §1.9 classifying map)
  is a `C`-map whose graph is a `Rel(C)`-map with `[graph Λ(R₀)] ≫ [∈_b] = [R₀]`.  This is
  the §2.413 EXISTENTIAL thickness for the unrestricted `R₀` (box guard ignored, hence
  strictly stronger than the `eps_thick` field needs — the §2.434 `globalScPrePower`
  pattern). -/

/-! ## §2.414  Straightness of `∋`

  Freyd: "The uniqueness condition in the definition of universal relations forces ∋ to
  be straight."  The BinRel core: any endo-relation `T₀` on a power object `P` that
  satisfies `T₀ ⊚ U ⊑ U` and `T₀° ⊚ U ⊑ U` (a symmetric `U`-congruence) is contained in
  the diagonal — because its two legs `p = T₀.colA`, `q = T₀.colB` then classify the same
  relation (`relPullback p U ≅ relPullback q U`), so `p = q` by uniqueness, and
  `T₀ ⊑ (graph p)° ⊚ graph p ⊑ 1`. -/

/-- **§2.414 core**: a symmetric `U`-congruence on `P` is contained in the diagonal, for a
    universal `U : BinRel P C`.  This is Freyd's "uniqueness forces straight," at the
    `BinRel`/relation-iso level. -/

  of the §1.784/§2.32 division allegory `relDivisionAllegory`.  Delivered as a `def` (not
  an `instance`) so its `toDivisionAllegory` projection is defeq to the existing

    properties a topos supplies), then `Rel(C)` is a POWER ALLEGORY.  `∋_b = [∈_b]` is the
