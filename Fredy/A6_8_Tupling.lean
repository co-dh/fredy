  The **tupling law** (Bird–de Moor / Fokkinga mutual-recursion law) for snoc-list
  catamorphisms, as a genuine calculational step in `Rel(Set)`.

  A function `h : SnocList L E → C` obeying the FIRST-ORDER lockstep recursion
    `h (wrap l)     = g l`
    `h (snoc xs e)  = step (h xs) e`
  is, by the initial-algebra universal property (uniqueness of the catamorphism), EXACTLY the
  catamorphism `⦇[g, step]⦈` of the algebra `[g, step]`.  When the carrier is a PRODUCT
  `C₁ × C₂` this is the tupling / linearization move: to compute a function that "looks back"
  more than one step (a second-order recurrence), carry a tuple of the last few values and run a
  single first-order fold.  The pair-carrying fold is then not written by hand and verified — it
  is PRODUCED by this law from the base `g` and the step `step`, both of which are read off the
  recurrence.  `Fredy/L70_derived.lean` and `Fredy/L1137_derived.lean` derive Fibonacci and
  Tribonacci this way.

  Reuses the whole `A6_SnocList` engine (`cataFold`, `cataR`, `cataFold_wrap`, `cataFold_snoc`)
  with ZERO new engine code.  Mathlib-free.

    `SnocList Unit Unit` is the initial algebra of `1 + X`, i.e. `ℕ`, so this is the isomorphism
    onto `ℕ` that lets a `ℕ`-recurrence be run as a snoc-list catamorphism.  Shared by every

/-! ## Banana-split (the non-cross-referencing special case)

  When the step does NOT feed one component from the other —
  `g l = (g₁ l, g₂ l)` and `step (a, b) e = (step₁ a e, step₂ b e)` — the pair-carrying fold
  decomposes as the *pairing* of two INDEPENDENT scalar folds (Bird–de Moor's banana-split law
  `⦇g₁ △ g₂⦈ = ⦇g₁⦈ △ ⦇g₂⦈`).  Fibonacci does NOT fit this shape: its step `(a,b) ↦ (b, a+b)`
  feeds the new second component from BOTH old values, so the general cross-referencing `tupling`
  is required — banana-split alone cannot linearize a genuine second-order recurrence. -/
