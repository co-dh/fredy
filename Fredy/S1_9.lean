/-! ## §1.9  Universal relation and power-object

  A relation from A to C is a jointly-monic span A ←— T —→ C (`BinRel 𝒞 A C`).
  Book §1.9: given a map f : A' → A and a relation U : BinRel 𝒞 A C, define
  `f ≫_rel U` (written `fU` in the book) as the pullback of U along f, which
  gives a relation A' ← (pullback) → C.

  A relation U : BinRel 𝒞 P C is UNIVERSAL (targeted at C) if for every A
  and every relation R : BinRel 𝒞 A C there exists a unique f : A → P such
  that R ≅ fU (the pullback of U along f).

  A POWER-OBJECT [C] is an object P together with a universal relation ∈_C
  targeted at C.  The classifying map Λ(R) : A → [C] is often written A_R. -/

/-! ## §1.912  Subobject classifier

  Relations from A to 1 correspond bijectively to subobjects of A (§1.912).
  The traditional name for [1] is Ω — the SUBOBJECT CLASSIFIER.
  The universal relation ∈_1 corresponds to the UNIVERSAL SUBOBJECT t : 1 → Ω.

  Reformulation entirely in terms of subobjects (monics):
  t : 1 → Ω is universal if for every monic m : A' → A there is a UNIQUE
  characteristic map χ_m : A → Ω making the square

      A' ----term A'----> 1
      |                   |
      m                   t
      v                   v
      A ------χ_m-------> Ω

  a pullback. -/

/-- A SUBOBJECT CLASSIFIER Ω with universal monic t : 1 → Ω (§1.912).
    For each monic m : A' → A, there is a unique characteristic map χ_m : A → Ω
    such that the square (m, term A', χ_m, true) is a pullback.

    Fields:
    - `classify`          : produces χ_m from a monic m
    - `classify_sq`       : m ≫ χ_m = term A' ≫ true  (square commutes)
    - `classify_pullback` : the cone is a pullback
    - `classify_unique`   : χ_m is the unique such map -/

/-- §1.912: `true : 1 → Ω` is monic — it is a SPLIT mono, retracted by the terminal map
    `Ω → 1` (terminal uniqueness gives `true ≫ (Ω→1) = 1₁`).  Derived here rather than
    postulated as a class field, so instances need not supply it. -/

/-- A TOPOS (§1.9, book p.9091): Cartesian category in which each object has a
    power-object.  Freyd's primary definition is the power-object one; the
    subobject classifier `Ω = [1]` is then a derived consequence (§1.912).  We
    bundle BOTH: the classifier presentation (`HasSubobjectClassifier`, the
    working interface for §1.91's Heyting layer) AND the power objects
    (`has_pow`), since recovering power objects from the bare classifier is
    Paré's theorem, which Freyd does not prove and this development does not need.
    Bundling `has_pow` is faithful to the book definition and supplies the
    `∀ C, HasPowerObject C` that §1.92's exponentials (`topos_has_exponentials`,
    §1.923) and §1.95's quotient covers rest on. -/

    `[∀ C, HasPowerObject C]` hypotheses (S1_91/S1_92) are auto-satisfied under

    object. -/
