  **The ultra-filter stalk reflects isos in a fully WELL-POINTED (capital) pre-logos.**

  This file discharges the last residual of the §2.218 *stalk route* (`relStalk_faithful`,
  `Fredy/S2_218.lean`): the hypothesis `hrefl` that the stalk `T_F̂` REFLECTS ISOS.

  The engine is Freyd's §1.526 *"the points functor is a representation in a capital category"*:
  in a category whose every object is WELL-POINTED, the global-points functor `Γ = Hom(1,-)`
  REFLECTS ISOS — `f` is iso iff it is bijective on points `1 → -`.  The bridge to the stalk is
  that, when the pre-filter `ℱ` contains the TOP subterminator `1` (automatic for a *filter*, in
  particular an ultra-filter, since `1` is complemented and every member is `≤ 1`), the canonical
  inclusion `Hom(1,A) ↪ T_F̂(A)` of the `U = 1` colimit stage is injective and natural, and it
  RETRACTS onto the global points: so `T_F̂(f)` iso forces `Γ(f)` bijective, hence `f` iso.

  NOTE ON THE WALL.  A single stalk reflects isos ONLY because the WHOLE category is well-pointed
  (the `1`-stage already sees every map apart).  In a merely `Capital` category (well-supported ⟹
  well-pointed) NOT every object is well-pointed, and a single stalk does not reflect isos — that is
  Freyd's *collectively faithful* family (§1.635, book p.123 line 247).  Full well-pointedness is
  exactly what the §1.543 capitalization tower delivers, and is the honest hypothesis here.

  STRICTLY MATHLIB-FREE; depends only on `Fredy.*`.

/-! ## §1.526 — the global-points functor `Γ = Hom(1,-)` reflects isos when every object is
    well-pointed.

  In a `PreLogos` (hence Cartesian: products + pullbacks ⟹ equalizers) we prove the three classical
  facts about `Γ`, each under the relevant well-pointedness, then combine them with `1`-stage of the
  stalk colimit. -/

/-- A `PreLogos` has EQUALIZERS (products + pullbacks ⟹ equalizers).  We install ONLY
    `HasEqualizers` (not a full `CartesianCategory`, which would re-export `HasBinaryProducts` and
    create an instance diamond with the genuine `PreLogos` one). -/

/-- **§1.526 (faithfulness).**  Maps out of a WELL-POINTED object are determined by their action on
    points: if `a, b : Z → W` agree after every point `x : 1 → Z` (`x ≫ a = x ≫ b`), and `Z` is
    well-pointed, then `a = b`.  PROOF: the equalizer `E ↣ Z` of `a, b` is monic; if it were not
    iso, well-pointedness of `Z` gives a point of `Z` missing `E`, i.e. a point on which `a, b`
    differ — contradiction.  So `E` is iso, forcing `a = b`. -/

    that `f` factors through (`g ≫ m = f`) is hit by every point of `Y` (lift the point through `f`,
    then it factors through `m`), so `m` misses no point; well-pointedness forces `m` iso. -/

    PROOF: the two kernel-pair projections `k₁, k₂ : K → X` satisfy `k₁ ≫ f = k₂ ≫ f`, so on every
    point `p : 1 → K` we get `(p≫k₁) ≫ f = (p≫k₂) ≫ f`, whence `p ≫ k₁ = p ≫ k₂` by injectivity;
    well-pointedness of `K` (`points_faithful`) makes `k₁ = k₂`, so the kernel-pair diagonal is iso

/-! ## The PRINCIPAL ultra-filter at the top: its stalk IS the global-points functor.

  Take `ℱ = principalTop := {U | U is entire (≅ 1)}`, the principal filter generated by the top
  subterminator.  Every member is `≅ 1`, so a `PrefilterMap principalTop A` is, up to the canonical
  factorization, a global point `1 → A`, and `PrefRel` collapses to plain equality of points (a
  common refinement `W` of two top-members is again `≅ 1`, with a UNIQUE `1 → W.dom` inverse to
  `W.arr`, so the refinement witnesses are forced and the maps must already agree).  Hence
  `T_principalTop A = Hom(1,A)` and `T_principalTop(f) = Γ(f) = (· ≫ f)`.  This is the cleanest
  single stalk for reflecting isos: its `hrefl` is exactly §1.526 points-conservativity. -/

  Plugging the principal-top stalk into Freyd's `relStalk_faithful` discharges BOTH residuals of the
  stalk route at once:
    • PROJECTIVITY (`hproj`): `principalTop`'s members are `≅ 1`, projective once `1` is projective
      (`principalTop_projective` ← `Projective one`, automatic in a capital category §1.525);
    • CONSERVATIVITY (`hrefl`): the principal stalk reflects isos in a fully well-pointed category
      (`principalStalk_reflects_iso`).
  Hence `Rel(T_principalTop) : Rel(𝒞) ⟶ Rel(Set)` is a FAITHFUL allegory morphism — the §2.218
  stalk-route faithfulness, needing only full well-pointedness `hwp` and `Projective one`. -/

/-! ## §2.218 (K2) — the stalk-route REPRESENTATION of a tabular allegory in `Rel(Set)`

  Wires `relStalk_faithful_of_wellPointed` into the §2.218 assembly: for a TABULAR unitary
  distributive allegory `𝒜`, the carrier bridge `bridgeFunctor : 𝒜 ⟶ Rel(Map 𝒜)` (faithful, R2) and
  a faithful regular allegory morphism `cap : Rel(Map 𝒜) ⟶ Rel(Ā)` from capitalizing `Map 𝒜 ↪ Ā`
  (R3) compose with the principal-top stalk `Rel(T) : Rel(Ā) ⟶ Rel(Set)` to a FAITHFUL allegory
  morphism `𝒜 ⟶ Rel(Set)` — a faithful representation in the allegory of relations in a *single* set
  (a fortiori in a power).  This is the STALK route to §2.218 (Freyd §1.635), which needs only
  `Projective one` + FULL well-pointedness of `Ā` (`hwp`), NOT all-objects-projective AC.

  RESIDUAL (R3, the §1.543 capital target).  `Ā` must be a `PreLogos` that is FULLY WELL-POINTED
  and has a faithful `cap` from the capitalization of `Map 𝒜`.  The §1.543 transfinite tower's
  generic regular packaging is `Freyd.capitalization_regular_of_cofinalSystem`
  (`Fredy/CapitalizationTransfinite.lean`), which delivers a regular CAPITAL target — but `Capital`
  (`∀ A, WellSupported A → WellPointed A`, S1_52) gives well-pointedness only on WELL-SUPPORTED
  objects, whereas the stalk's iso-reflection (`principalStalk_reflects_iso`) needs FULL `∀ A,
  WellPointed A`.  That full well-pointedness is the genuine remaining residual of §1.543
  capitalization (see the §2.218 marker in `S2_21.lean`); it is surfaced here as the explicit
  `hwp` hypothesis, alongside `[PreLogos Ā]` and the bridge `cap`. -/
