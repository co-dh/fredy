  LeetCode 35 — Search Insert Position — DERIVED, in TWO parts: (1) the book's O(n) linear scan
  EMERGES as a `Nat`-carrier `ConsList` catamorphism, and (2) that scan is bridged to the already
  VERIFIED O(log n) `Freyd.BinSearch.lowerBound`, giving the log-time program for free.

  1. **Part 1 — emergence.**  `Fredy/L35.lean`'s `insertPosFn` is a front-to-back scan holding an
     external parameter `target : Int` fixed; for each `target` it is the recursion `h (wrap ()) =
     0`, `h (cons x xs) = if target ≤ x then 0 else 1 + h xs`.  Feeding base `g target` and step
     `st target` to the general-carrier law `Freyd.Alg.RelSet.CL.consFold_unique`
     (`Fredy/A6_GenFold.lean`) produces `foldFn target` as `cataR (consScalarAlg (g target)
     (st target))` — the recursion is never hand-written.  `foldFn` is bridged to `insertPosFn` on
     `CL.ofList`-reshaped input by structural induction, giving the UNCONDITIONAL equality
     `derivedSolve = LC35.solve` (Headline shape 1 — the answer is a function of the input, no
     `Sorted` precondition needed, exactly as `insertPos_correct` remarks).

  2. **Part 2 — the O(n) → O(log n) bridge.**  `Fredy/A6_BinSearch.lean`'s `lowerBound` is the
     verified halving search: `lowerBound a x` is the least `i ≤ a.size` with `x ≤ a[i]`.  On a
     `Sorted` list, `insertPosFn` and `lowerBound` characterize the SAME index (the split point
     "before it `< target`, at it `≥ target`"), and that splitting index is unique.
     `lowerBound_eq_insertPosFn` proves this by the split-index uniqueness argument: trichotomy on
     the two candidate indices, each branch contradicted by pitting one search's "left of split is
     `< target`" clause against the other's "at split is `≥ target`" clause
     (`BinSearch.lt_of_lt_lowerBound`/`BinSearch.le_of_lowerBound_le` vs `insertPos_correct`'s own
     two clauses).  `LC35.insertPos_correct`'s SPEC is reused verbatim; nothing about correctness is
     re-derived.  Headline shape 1 again, now conditional on `Sorted` (binary search's own
     precondition): `derivedSolveBS = LC35.solve` pointwise on sorted inputs.  Complexity: Part 1 is
     O(n) (one comparison per element, same as the book scan); Part 2 is O(log n) (halving search on
     the sorted array) — `lowerBound`'s `go` does O(log n) comparisons (Lean verifies behaviour, not
     running time).

  Mathlib-free; headline axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}.

/-! ## Part 1: the linear scan EMERGES as a `Nat`-carrier cons-list fold (one instance per
    `target`, since `target` is an external parameter, not part of the recursive structure). -/

/-- Base of the emergent algebra: the empty list scans to index `0`. -/
def g (target : Int) : Unit → Nat := fun _ => 0

/-- Step of the emergent algebra: stop (`0`) once the head is `≥ target`, otherwise recurse on the
    tail and add one — exactly `LC35.insertPosFn`'s own step. -/

/-- The linear-scan fold, as structural recursion on the front-to-back `ConsList` (`target` held
    fixed).  Its own defining equations (`foldFn_wrap`/`foldFn_cons` below) are exactly `g`/`st`. -/

/-- **The program EMERGES from the general-carrier fold law.**  `foldFn target` is PRODUCED by

/-- The `ConsList` fold agrees with `LC35.insertPosFn` on the `CL.ofList`-reshaped raw input, by
    structural induction (both sides unfold to the SAME `if target ≤ x then 0 else 1 + ⋯` step). -/
