  LeetCode 322 — Coin Change — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM (`min·Λ` dynamic programming).

  Problem: given coin denominations `coins` (positive, possibly repeated — a non-empty
  `SnocList Nat Nat`) and a target `amount`, find the FEWEST coins (with repetition) summing to
  `amount`, or report "impossible".

  This is the archetypal Bird–de Moor DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING shape (`Fredy.A9_1`,
  `dynamic_programming`): unfold the amount `a` in ALL possible ways (pick a coin `c ≤ a`,
  leaving subproblem `a - c`), solve each subproblem recursively, refold by `+1` (using one more
  coin) and take the `≤`-MINIMUM over all choices.  Unlike `L121`/`L53`/`L152` (a linear scan over
  a `SnocList` of INPUT data), the recursion here is over the AMOUNT axis, and the "achievable"
  answer set can be empty (`amount` unreachable) — so the target lattice is `Option Nat`, `none`
  standing for `∞` ("impossible"), ordered so `none` is the TOP element (worse than every finite
  count).

  1. **The `∞` lattice.** `omin : Option Nat → Option Nat → Option Nat` (`none` = ∞ is the
     identity/top of `omin`) and `osucc : Option Nat → Option Nat` (`+1`, `none ↦ none`) — the
     small mathlib-free algebra the fold is built from.
  2. **Program.** `dp coins 0 = some 0`; `dp coins (a+1)` folds `omin` over every denomination `c`
     of `coins` with `1 ≤ c ≤ a+1`, contributing `osucc (dp coins (a+1-c))`.  Implemented via an
     explicit FUEL parameter (`dpFuel`) so the recursion is ordinary STRUCTURAL recursion on the
     fuel (not well-founded recursion on `<`), keeping the definition kernel-reducible — `decide`
     needs to unfold it directly, unlike `WellFounded.fix`-based recursion.
  3. **Specification.** `Achievable coins n a` — a multiset of exactly `n` coins from `coins`
     (each `≥ 1`, repetition allowed) sums to `a`. `coinSpec coins a k` is the extremum spec: `k =
     some n` iff `n` is the ≤-MINIMUM `n'` with `Achievable coins n' a`; `k = none` iff no `n'`
     achieves `a` at all. This is `min(≤)·Λ Achievable`, valued in the `∞`-extended lattice.
  4. **Correctness.** `dpFuel_spec`: for `a ≤ fuel`, `coinSpec coins a (dpFuel coins fuel a)` — by
     induction on `fuel`, reducing to a generic lemma about `coinFold` (the per-level `omin`-fold
     over the coin list) relating its `omin`-fold output to the `Achievable`-successor structure
     (`achievable_succ_iff`). Instantiating at `fuel = amount` gives `solve`'s full correctness:
     `coinSpec coins amount (solveFn coins amount)`, both refinement (achievability) and
     domination (minimality) in one theorem — `coinSpec` already bundles both halves, together
     with the `none`/impossibility direction (`L121`-style problems never needed this third case).

/-! ## Why the correctness above is a direct fuel induction, NOT `A9_1.dynamic_programming`

  The natural hope is to derive `solve_correct` from Bird–de Moor's Theorem 9.1
  (`Freyd.Alg.dynamic_programming`, `Fredy.A9_1`) by instantiating its abstract data at
  `Rel(Set)`:
  * functor `F X = Unit ⊕ (Nat × X)` — `Freyd.Alg.RelSet.CL.F Unit Nat`, whose initial algebra
    `ConsList Unit Nat` (`CL.initial Unit Nat`) is exactly "coin sequences";
  * amount coalgebra `T : F Nat ⟶ Nat` — `inl () ↦ 0`, `inr (c, a') ↦ a' + c` for valid `c`
    (`mem coins c ∧ 1 ≤ c`);
  * counting algebra `h : F Nat ⟶ Nat` — `inl () ↦ 0`, `inr (c, n) ↦ n + 1`;
  * cost order `R := (≤)` on `Nat`.

  This instantiation is entirely LEGAL — every hypothesis of `dynamic_programming` discharges:
  `Map h` (`graph_map`), `R ≫ R ⊑ R` (transitivity of `≤`), `MonotonicAlg h R`
  (`F.map (≤) ≫ h = h ≫ (≤)`, pointwise: both send `inr (c, m)` to `{k | m + 1 ≤ k}`),
  `F.PreservesRecip` (`CL.F_preservesRecip`), `InitialAlgebra` (`CL.initial Unit Nat`).  The
  SPECIFICATION side even identifies cleanly: with `H := (relCata I T)° ≫ relCata I h` one has
  `H a n ↔ Achievable coins n a`, and `A_comp_minRel` gives
  `A H ≫ minRel R = H ∩ (H° \ R)`, so `(A H ≫ minRel R) a n ↔ coinSpec coins a (some n)`.

  What FAILS is the bridge from the executable `dp` to the theorem's `μ`-body.  That body,
  `A (T°) ≫ powerRel (F.map X ≫ h) ≫ minRel R`, uses the EGLI–MILNER power relator `powerRel`
  (`Fredy.A5_4`), whose "term₁" is `((∋)° \ (g ≫ (∋)°))`; on `Rel(Set)` this reads
  `powerRel g P Q → ∀ t ∈ P, ∃ u ∈ Q, g t u`.  Here `A (T°) a` is the FULL set of one-step
  decompositions of `a` (ALL valid coins `c ≤ a`), so `μ(body) a` is nonempty only when EVERY
  such coin leaves a solvable sub-amount `a − c`.  Coin change needs only ONE good
  decomposition: with `coins = {2, 3}`, amount `3` is solvable (a single `3`-coin,
  `dp = some 1`), yet the `c = 2` branch leaves the unsolvable sub-amount `1`, forcing
  `μ(body) 3 = ∅` (indeed `μ(body) 1 = ∅` already, since `1` has no valid coin, and that dead
  branch propagates up).  Hence `dp`-as-a-relation is NOT `⊑ μ(body)`, and Theorem 9.1's
  refinement `μ(body) ⊑ spec` cannot transport the executable's correctness — no amount of
  extra infrastructure removes this, it is a genuine semantic gap, not a missing lemma.

  Theorem 9.1 faithfully models DPs whose coalgebra unfolds a FINITE INPUT structure so that
  every branch is productive (B&dM's own §9.2/§9.4 — edit distance, compression — recurse on
  input lists, where every unfold reaches the base).  The amount-axis coin search, with dead
  sub-amounts, is not of that form, so the faithful choice is the direct fuel induction above.
