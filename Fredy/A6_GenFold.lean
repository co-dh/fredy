  **General-carrier fold-uniqueness laws** for snoc-lists and binary trees.

  `A6_8_Tupling.tupling` and `A6_9_TreeTupling.treeTupling` state catamorphism uniqueness only for a
  PRODUCT carrier `C₁ × C₂` (the linearization / tupling use-case).  Their proofs, however, never
  touch the product structure — they are the general fact that a structural fold into ANY carrier
  `C` is the catamorphism of the corresponding algebra.  This file packages that general statement,
  which unlocks two carrier shapes the product law cannot express directly:

  * carrier `C := List D` — a **tabulating / course-of-values fold** whose step reads the whole
    table of previous results (`A6_TabDP`, used by Coin-Change / Word-Break, where `dp[i]` depends
    on ALL earlier `dp[j]`, not a fixed-width window); and
  * carrier `C := Tree B → Bool` (or `Tree B → Tree C`) — a **higher-order / lockstep fold** that
    walks a SECOND tree in step with the first (`A6_TreeZip`, used by Same-Tree / Symmetric /
    Merge-Trees, the two-input case).

  The tupling laws are then the `C = C₁ × C₂` instances of these — kept as separate named laws only
  because the product-projection API (`tupling_fst`, banana-split) is convenient there.  Mathlib-free.
