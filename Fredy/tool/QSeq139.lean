  The user's §1.39 blackboard proof that ⟨x,y⟩ is monic, in three forms:

    PART 1  — the proof itself, as a direct Lean term (`monic_of_monicPair`): the projection
              chase.  Assume the parallel pair a,b : W ⇉ T agree after ⟨x,y⟩ (the puncture:
              a=b is NOT assumed); post-compose fst, snd to get a≫x=b≫x, a≫y=b≫y; the
              §1.41 monic pair x,y then forces a=b.

    PART 2  — the same statement as a §1.395 Q-SEQUENCE (the §1.41 *second* monic-pair
              diagram, puncture form) with its satisfaction relation `SatMon` written in the
              faithful ∀/∃ shape — a ∀-bar binding a,b with the HYPOTHESIS panel a≫m=b≫m,
              then an ∃-bar imposing the CONCLUSION panel a=b (∃ over the propositional
              witness that the imposed equation holds — exactly §1.395's "∃ a functor into the
              quotient iff the equation holds").  Proved equivalent to `Monic m` and, for the
              pairing, to `MonicPair x y`.

    PART 2' — the SYNTACTIC Q-sequence as pure data (`monicPairQSeq`), the object the generic
              renderer (`QSeq139Render.lean`) consumes; `satMon_is_meaning` records that its
              §1.395 satisfaction is `SatMon`.

/-! ## Part 1 — the projection-chase proof (the user's §1.39 blackboard argument) -/

/-- §1.41/§1.426 (one direction), the user's diagram proof read off arrow-by-arrow:
    a MONIC PAIR `x : T→A`, `y : T→B` makes the pairing `⟨x,y⟩ : T → A×B` monic.

    Read the tactic block as the blackboard sequence:
    * `intro W a b hab` — draw the parallel pair `a, b : W ⇉ T` with `a⟨x,y⟩ = b⟨x,y⟩`
      asserted; the goal `a = b` is the PUNCTURED equation (not assumed — to be derived).
    * `refine hxy a b ?_ ?_` — the monic pair `x,y` reduces `a = b` to its two feet
      `a≫x = b≫x` and `a≫y = b≫y`.
    * each `calc` — EXTEND by a projection (`fst`, then `snd`) and use `⟨x,y⟩≫fst = x`,
      `⟨x,y⟩≫snd = y`: the asserted `a⟨x,y⟩ = b⟨x,y⟩` post-composes down to the foot equation,
      removing the puncture. -/

/-! ## Part 2 — the §1.395 satisfaction of the monic Q-sequence (∀/∃ puncture form) -/

/-- §1.395 satisfaction of the two-bar MONIC Q-sequence for `m : T ⟶ P` (the §1.41 second
    diagram).  The `∀`-bar ranges over the parallel pair `a, b : W ⇉ T` constrained by the
    HYPOTHESIS panel `a≫m = b≫m`; the `∃`-bar imposes the CONCLUSION panel `a = b` — written
    as `∃ _ : a = b, True`, i.e. "there exists a functor into the `a=b`-quotient", which is
    inhabited exactly when the equation `a = b` holds (§1.395).  No new object is introduced
    by the `∃`-bar, matching the §1.41 remark that an `!` is safe with no vertex after it. -/
