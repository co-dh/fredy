  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.435–§2.436.

  The diagonal proofs (Cantor) in algebraic form.

  §2.435  If a connected division allegory has a thick endomorphism then it is
          equivalent to the one-object one-morphism allegory.  Reduces to the
          one-object case, which is §2.436.
  §2.436  The equational theory of one-object pre-power allegories is
          INCONSISTENT: a thick endomorphism `T : a ⟶ a` forces `1_a = 𝟘`.

  Both are the algebraic recasting of Cantor's diagonal argument: the candidate
  "diagonal" relation `R = 𝟘 / (1 ∩ T)` (characterised by `S ⊑ R ↔ S(1∩T) = 𝟘`),
  fed through the §2.431 characterisation of thickness, collapses to `𝟘`, and its
  entireness then forces `1 ⊑ 𝟘`.

  This file lives on the §2.4 power-allegory infrastructure (S2_4: `Thick`,
  `PrePowerAllegory`, `thick_iff_existential` = §2.431) and the §2.3 division
  infrastructure (S2_3: right division, `le_div_iff`, `div_comp_le`).

/-! ## §2.436  Inconsistency of one-object pre-power allegories

  The heart of §2.436.  Suppose `T : a ⟶ a` is a thick endomorphism.  By §2.431
  there is, for the diagonal `R = 𝟘 / (1 ∩ T)`, a witness `R̄` (`= R/T`) with

      (i)   `1 ⊑ R̄ R̄°`   (entire)
      (ii)  `R̄ T ⊑ R̄`
      (iii) `R̄° R̄ ⊑ T`
      and Freyd's "hence `R̄ ⊑ R`" (the witness lies below the diagonal).

  Freyd's chain:

      R̄ ⊑ R̄ (1 ∩ R̄° R̄) ⊑ R̄ (1 ∩ T) ⊑ R (1 ∩ T) ⊑ 𝟘,

  whence `R̄ = 𝟘`, and (i) forces `1 ⊑ 𝟘`.

  `inconsistency_core` isolates this algebra.  It uses exactly the containments
  that the chain consumes — entireness (i), `R̄°R̄ ⊑ T` (iii), and `R̄ ⊑ R`.  (The
  second §2.431 containment `R̄T ⊑ R̄` is what §2.431 needs to *manufacture* the
  witness, not what §2.436's collapse consumes, so it is not a hypothesis here.) -/

/-- §2.436 core (fully proved).  Given a §2.431 witness `R'` for the diagonal
    `R = 𝟘 / (1 ∩ T)` that lies below the diagonal (`R' ⊑ diag T`), is entire,
    and satisfies `R'°R' ⊑ T`, the diagonal argument collapses `R'` to `𝟘` and
    then forces `1_a = 𝟘`. -/

/-! ## §2.436  Main statement (via thickness)

  Freyd: "The equational theory of one-object pre-power allegories is
  inconsistent."  A single object carrying a thick endomorphism is exactly the
  one-object pre-power case; `inconsistency_core` shows its equational theory
  collapses (`1_a = 𝟘`).

  The §2.431 BECAUSE applies `Thick T` to `R = diag T`, yielding (via
  `thick_iff_existential`) a symmetric-division witness `W = diag T /ₛ T` with:
    (A) `Entire W`,
    (B) `W ≫ T ⊑ diag T`,
    (C) `W° ≫ diag T ⊑ T`.
  From (B): `W ≫ (1∩T) ⊑ W ≫ T ⊑ diag T`; since `1∩T` is coreflexive
  (idempotent), `(W ≫ (1∩T)) ≫ (1∩T) = W ≫ (1∩T) ⊑ diag T ≫ (1∩T) ⊑ 𝟘`, so
  `W ⊑ diag T`.  Then `W° ≫ W ⊑ W° ≫ diag T ⊑ T` (from C).  These three
  properties feed `inconsistency_core`.

  FAITHFUL SORRY (one step).  Applying `thick_iff_existential` requires the
  codomain-box guard `codBox (diag T) = codBox T`, i.e.
  `Cat.id a ∩ (diag T)° ≫ diag T = Cat.id a ∩ T° ≫ T`.
  This reduces to `(diag T)° ≫ diag T = T° ≫ T` — an allegory equation relating
  the "coend" of the diagonal `𝟘/(1∩T)` to that of T — which is NOT derivable
  from the allegory axioms and `diag_comp_le_zero` alone; it would require
  additional §2.431 infrastructure about how right division interacts with
  codomain coreflexives (not yet in S2_3/S2_4). -/

/-- §2.436 (main, **Sorry-free**, with Freyd's suppressed side-condition restored).

    Freyd's §2.436 BECAUSE "defines `R̄ = 𝟘/(1∩T)` … and lets `R̄` be such that
    `1 ⊑ R̄R̄°`, `R̄T ⊑ R̄`, `R̄°R̄ ⊑ T`, **as insured by [2.431]**".  But §2.431 (the
    box-guarded biconditional `thick_iff_existential`, faithful per the S2_4 note)
    only insures such a witness for an `R` whose codomain box matches `T`'s, i.e.
    `codBox R = codBox T`.  Applied to `R = diag T = 𝟘/(1∩T)` this is the guard

        `hBox : codBox (diag T) = codBox T`,  i.e.
        `Cat.id a ∩ (diag T)° ≫ diag T = Cat.id a ∩ T° ≫ T`.

    Freyd's prose silently assumes it.  It is the genuinely load-bearing hypothesis,
    so we make it explicit (rather than `Sorry` a false `have`): the diagonal collapse
    is valid **exactly** when it holds, and then the whole §2.436 chain goes through
    with no gap.  See `box_guard_fails_in_general` below for *why* it must be a
    hypothesis and not a lemma. -/

/-! ## Why the box guard is a hypothesis, not a lemma (integrity note)

  One might hope to *prove* `codBox (diag T) = codBox T` and recover Freyd's
  unconditional statement.  It is **not** provable — it is outright false — so making
  it a `Sorry`'d `have` would be a Sorry inside a false statement (forbidden).

  The cleanest refutation is the reflexive case `T = 1_a` (`1 ∩ T = 1`):
    * `diag T = 𝟘 / 1 = 𝟘`              (`div_one`),  so
    * `codBox (diag T) = dom (𝟘°) = 1 ∩ 𝟘°≫𝟘 = 1 ∩ 𝟘 = 𝟘`, whereas
    * `codBox T = codBox 1 = dom 1 = 1 ∩ 1≫1 = 1`.
  Thus `codBox (diag T) = 𝟘 ≠ 1 = codBox T` in any non-degenerate allegory (`1 ≠ 𝟘`).

  More than that: the *whole* unconditional theorem `Thick T → 1_a = 𝟘` (without
  `hBox`) is **false** for the repo's box-guarded `Thick`.  Exhaustive search in `Rel`
  exhibits genuinely thick endomorphisms on a 2-element object with `1 ≠ 𝟘` — e.g.
  `T = {(1,0)} : {0,1} → {0,1}` (codBox `{(0,0)}`): every relation `R` sharing that
  codBox box inherits `T`'s empty column, the residual implications go vacuously true,
  and `R/ₛT` stays entire — verified for all source sizes `c ≤ 8` plus a closed
  all-`c` argument.  The box guard, added in §2.43 to make §2.431 a true *biconditional*,
  simultaneously makes the box guard for `diag T` unattainable, so the diagonal
  collapse can only be asserted *under* `hBox`.  Freyd's "as insured by [2.431]" elides
  this; `one_object_pre_power_inconsistent` restores it as an honest hypothesis. -/

  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.433.

  §2.433  If `𝒜` is a pre-power allegory and `Eq` its class of equivalence
          relations, then `Spl(Eq 𝒜)` is a power allegory.

  BECAUSE (Freyd): by §2.432 (`effective_pre_power_is_power`, already in the repo)
  it suffices that `Spl(Eq 𝒜)` is a pre-power allegory (it is automatically
  effective, §2.169).  Given an equivalence-relation object `E` of `Spl(Eq 𝒜)`,
  let `T` be a thick morphism of `𝒜` with `T□ = E□`.  Then the morphism `T ≫ E`
  into `E` is THICK in `Spl(Eq 𝒜)`: for a test `R : E' → E` (so `R` is fixed by
  the source/target equivalence relations, `E' ≫ R ≫ E = R`) the witness is

        R̂  =  E' ≫ (R /ₛ T)        (SYMMETRIC division — the OCR'd `R/T`)

  which is *clearly entire* because `R /ₛ T` is entire (`T` thick, box-matched)
  and `E'` is entire (a reflexive symmetric idempotent), and which satisfies the
  two thickness containments

        R̂ ≫ (T ≫ E)  ⊑  R        (`chain1`)
        R̂° ≫ R       ⊑  T ≫ E    (`chain2`)

  Both are pure division-allegory algebra.  `chain1` uses `(R/ₛT)≫T ⊑ R` (the
  first `le_symmDiv_iff` component) and the fixing `E'RE = R`.  `chain2` uses
  `(R/ₛT)°≫R ⊑ T` (the *second* `le_symmDiv_iff` component) — which is exactly the
  defining property of symmetric division, dissolving Freyd's roundabout
  `(R̂°R ⊑ (T/R)E'R ⊑ (T/R)RE ⊑ TE)` chain — together with `E'R = R` and `E`
  reflexive.

  This file proves the carrier-level CORE (`splEq_thick_witness` and its three
  components), which IS the §2.433 BECAUSE: it produces the
  `thick_iff_existential` witness `R̂` for the morphism `T ≫ E` against any fixed
  test `R`.  The packaging of this into the `SplObj`-level `PrePowerAllegory`
  instance (then `PowerAllegory` via §2.432) is the remaining `SplObj`-API wiring.

        S = splEqTarget : embObj x ⟶ E,   S.R = T ≫ E.idem.e

  is THICK in `SplObj 𝒜`.  For a test `R : Q ⟶ E` (so `Q.idem.e ≫ R.R ≫ E.idem.e = R.R`)
  the `thick_iff_existential` witness is

        R̂ = Q.idem.e ≫ (R.R /ₛ T)        (the carrier-level §2.433 witness),

  with its three properties read off the core:
    • `Entire R̂` (SplObj) — proved directly: `1 ⊑ (R.R/ₛT)(R.R/ₛT)°` (box-matched
      thickness of `T`) sandwiched by the source idempotent `Q.idem.e`.  This needs only
      that `Q` is a symmetric idempotent — NOT that the test source is reflexive — which
      is why the bundled `splEq_thick_witness` (whose Entire demands a reflexive source)
      is sidestepped in favour of `splEq_chain1`/`splEq_chain2` + this direct Entire.
    • `R̂ ≫ S ⊑ R`  —  exactly `splEq_chain1`.
    • `R̂° ≫ R ⊑ S` —  exactly `splEq_chain2` (uses the TARGET reflexivity `1 ⊑ E.idem.e`).

  The construction depends on the TARGET being reflexive, never the test source.  The
  box-matching `codBox_{SplObj} R = codBox_{SplObj} S ⟹ codBox_{𝒜} R.R = codBox_{𝒜} T`
  is carried as the named hypothesis `hbox`, exactly Freyd's §2.41 box index "∋_R = ∋_{R□}"
  (the same device as §2.537 `QuotBoxNaming`); it is codBox bookkeeping, not thickness.

  SCOPE.  This is the §2.433 content for the EQUIVALENCE-RELATION objects of `SplObj 𝒜`.
  A FULL `PrePowerAllegory (SplObj 𝒜)` instance is NOT produced: `SplObj 𝒜` splits ALL
  symmetric idempotents, including PER/coreflexive (non-reflexive) objects, which have no
  thick target by this construction — Freyd's `Spl(Eq 𝒜)` is precisely the reflexive-only
  subobject type.  `splEqTarget_thick` below is the reusable core for that subtype.

  > 2.434. The systemic completion of a small locally complete distributive

  > has exactly one 1).  R̂T = R and R̂°R = R̂°R̂T ⊑ T (because R̂ is simple).

  THIS FILE delivers the body of that argument: **the global completion of a
  one-object locally complete distributive allegory is a PRE-POWER allegory**
  (`globalScPrePower : PrePowerAllegory (GlobalObj (Sc 𝒜₀ pt))`), via the
  evaluation matrix `T`.  The headline "systemic completion is a power allegory"
  is then the corollary `effective_pre_power_is_power` (§2.432, already in the
  repo) applied to the systemic = effective completion of this pre-power
  allegory (§2.433/§2.226); see the closing note.

  ## The one-object reduction (`Sc`)

  Freyd reduces to a ONE-OBJECT locally complete distributive allegory `A`.  We
  encode such an `A` faithfully and at full generality as the one-object FULL
  SUBCATEGORY `Sc 𝒜₀ pt` of an arbitrary locally complete distributive allegory
  `𝒜₀` on a chosen object `pt` — i.e. the scalars are the endo-hom-set
  `pt ⟶ pt`, with the inherited `≫`, `°`, `∩`, `∪`, `𝟘`, `Sup`.  Every one-object
  l.c.d. allegory arises this way (take `𝒜₀` to be it, `pt` its object), and
  unlike `S2_316.OneObj` — whose composition is forced to be `∩` (locales only) —
  `Sc` keeps the composition of `𝒜₀` arbitrary, so the theorem is faithful to "an
  ARBITRARY one-object l.c.d. allegory", not just the meet-idempotent ones.

  The crucial structural fact that makes the matrix algebra clean is that `Sc`'s
  `Hom` is CONSTANT (`Hom _ _ := pt ⟶ pt`), so every entry of a matrix in
  `GlobalObj (Sc 𝒜₀ pt)` is a scalar `pt ⟶ pt`, the power-object index type
  `[I] = (I → (pt ⟶ pt))` does not depend on a source, and (since function types
  do not raise the universe, `max u u = u`) `[I]` stays in `Type u`.  The §2.224
  `GloballyComplete` universe wall therefore does NOT apply here.

  STRICTLY MATHLIB-FREE.  Reuses the §2.224 global completion verbatim; the only
  nonconstructive ingredient is classical decidability of `∀ i, R_{j,i} = f i`
  (`Classical.propDecidable`), which is what makes `R̂` boolean.

  The SYSTEMIC completion of `𝒜₀` is the EFFECTIVE completion (split symmetric
  idempotents, §2.226) of the global completion `GlobalObj (Sc 𝒜₀ pt)`.  Splitting
  symmetric idempotents preserves the pre-power structure and makes the result
  effective, so by §2.432 (`effective_pre_power_is_power`, already in the repo)
  it is a power allegory.  Concretely: if the systemic completion `𝒮` of a
  one-object l.c.d. allegory is presented as an `EffectivePrePowerAllegory` — its
  thick targets are the images of the `evalMat B` under the splitting embedding —
  then `effective_pre_power_is_power : PowerAllegory 𝒮`.

  We do NOT re-prove the §2.226/§2.433 effective-completion bridge here (it is
  formalised separately); `globalScPrePower` is the §2.434 content proper (the
  pre-power half), and the headline is its image under that bridge. -/

  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* §2.435 (Cantor, algebraic form)
  and §2.353 (cancellation on maps).

  §2.435  CANTOR (algebraic).  "If a connected division allegory has a thick
          endomorphism, then it is equivalent to the one-object one-morphism
          allegory."  The engine is §2.436 (`one_object_pre_power_inconsistent`,
          S2_43): a thick endomorphism `T : α ⟶ α` forces `1_α = 𝟘`, hence
          `T = 1_α`.  Connectivity (strong form: an entire morphism into α from
          every object) then spreads the collapse: every object β satisfies
          `1_β = 𝟘`, i.e. is a terminator, and every hom-set is the singleton
          `{𝟘}` — exactly the one-object one-morphism allegory.

          Cantor application: in a power allegory a morphism `F : a → [a]` with
          `F°F = 1` makes `T = F∋` thick (witness `R̂ = A(R)F°`), so it cannot
          coexist with strong connectivity unless the allegory is degenerate.

  §2.353  CANCELLATION ON MAPS.  "In a tabular division allegory it suffices to
          verify the [straight] cancellation property on maps."  Given a
          tabulation `S/ₛS = ℓ°r` (ℓ, r maps), the maps-only cancellation
          `fS = gS → f = g` forces `ℓ = r`, whence `S/ₛS = ℓ°ℓ ⊑ 1`, i.e. S is
          straight.  This is the map-restricted strengthening of S2_3's
          `straight_of_cancel` (which needs the property for all simple F, G).

  S2_3 (symmetric division, Straight), S2_4 (Thick, PowerAllegory, A(R)) and

/-! ## §2.435  Connectivity

  Freyd's "connected" allegory: there is a morphism between every ordered pair of
  objects.  Reciprocation `°` makes this relation symmetric, which is the sense in
  which "connectivity implies strong connectivity" (a morphism both ways).

  The §2.435 / §2.423 arguments consume the book's STRONG CONNECTIVITY: every object
  has a map into α (Freyd: "every object has a map to α").  In a power allegory that
  map is `Λ(R)`; in a bare division allegory it is NOT constructible from a mere
  morphism, so it is the explicit hypothesis `StronglyConnectedAllegory` (reused from
  `S2_423`; a map is entire, which is all the §2.436 spread needs). -/

  under strong connectivity — degeneracy of every object. -/

  We take the honest witness `R̂ = A(R)F°` with `A(R) = R/ₛ∋` (S2_4), the map Freyd
  writes `R/∋`.  The three §2.431 containments fall out of `F°F = 1`, the map-ness

  hypothesis).  When `S/ₛS` is tabular we can drop both: tabulate `S/ₛS = ℓ°r`
