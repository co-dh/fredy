  LeetCode 198 — House Robber — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a non-empty array of house values `x₀,…,x_{n-1}` (any `Int`, positive or
  negative), choose a subset of houses with NO TWO ADJACENT indices, maximising the sum of the
  chosen values.  Robbing nothing (the empty selection, sum `0`) is always allowed.

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L53.lean` / `Fredy/L121.lean` (see `Fredy/leetcode.md`, skill S0/S1):

  1. **Data** — the array is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ`
     (`Fredy.A6_SnocList`); `wrap x` is a single house, `snoc xs p` appends a house.

  2. **Program** — the classic House-Robber DP is the fold with state `(best, prevBest)`:
     `best` = the optimal robbery of the whole (sub)list, `prevBest` = the optimal robbery of the
     same (sub)list with its LAST house forbidden.  Algebra
     `[ x ↦ (max x 0, 0),  ((best,prevBest),p) ↦ (max best (prevBest+p), best) ]`.  We package it
     as a `Map` `solve : Arr ⟶ ℤ` in `Rel(Set)` and prove it *is* the catamorphism of that algebra
     followed by the FIRST projection (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — two mutually-referencing relations, split by "is the last house taken?":
     `robF xs v` — `v` is achievable WITHOUT taking `xs`'s last house; `robT xs v` — `v` is
     achievable BY taking `xs`'s last house (so the predecessor's last house must be free, i.e.
     the rest is a `robF`-selection).  `robSpec = robF ∨ robT` is the relation of ALL achievable
     robberies.  LeetCode 198 asks for its `≤`-maximum, `max (≤) · Λ robSpec`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum: it returns an achievable robbery
     (part of `solve_correct`, giving `solve ⊑ spec`) and dominates every achievable robbery (the
     other part).  Together this is `solve = max (≤) · Λ robSpec`, evaluated pointwise in the Set
     model.
