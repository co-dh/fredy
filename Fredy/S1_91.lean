/-! ## §1.913  Subobjects as equalizers

  In a topos, every monic m : A' → A is the equalizer of its characteristic
  map χ_m : A → Ω and the constant-true map A → 1 → Ω.

  BECAUSE: A' → A is a pullback of t : 1 → Ω along χ_m.  In a category
  with a terminator, any pullback of a monic is an equalizer. -/

/-- **§1.913**: In a topos, each monic `m : A' → A` is the equalizer of its
    characteristic map `χ_m` and the constant-true map `A → 1 → Ω`.

    Stated as the universal property of the equalizer (a `Prop`, so the proof is
    choice-free): `m` equalizes the pair, and every `e` that equalizes factors
    uniquely through `m`.  Both parts come from the classifier pullback square
    (`classify_pullback`): `m` is the pullback of `t : 1 → Ω` along `χ_m`, and a
    pullback of `t` is exactly an equalizer of `χ_m` and `A → 1 → Ω`. -/

/-- **§1.913 (balanced)**: A topos is BALANCED — a morphism that is both monic
    and epic is an isomorphism.  Since `m` is the equalizer of `χ_m` and
    `A → 1 → Ω` (`monic_is_equalizer`), epicness collapses `χ_m = term ≫ true`,
    so `1_B` equalizes the pair and factors through `m`, splitting it; a split
    epic mono is iso. -/

/-- **§1.913**: In a topos, covers coincide with epimorphisms.
    Forward: every cover is epic (`cover_epi`, general).  Converse: an epic `f`
    has an epic image-monic `(image f).arr`, which is then iso by balancedness
    (`topos_mono_epi_iso`), so `image f` is entire and `f` is a cover. -/

/-! ## §1.919  Monic endomorphisms of Ω are involutions

  §1.919: Every monic endomorphism g : Ω → Ω is an involution (g² = id).
  BECAUSE: g acts on subobjects as a "g-large" filter; monic-ness forces it
  to be an isomorphism of order at most 2. -/

/-- **§1.919**: Every monic endomorphism of Ω is an involution;
    that is, g : Ω → Ω monic implies g ≫ g = id.

    Proof sketch (Freyd): Let g be monic.  g acts on subobjects via
    post-composition: it sends χ : A → Ω to g∘χ : A → Ω.  Since g is
    monic, if A is the subobject classified by χ, then A is also the
    subobject classified by g∘χ (because g∘χ = g∘χ' ⇒ χ = χ').
    But the subobject classified by g∘g∘χ is the same as that
    classified by χ (by considering the pullback of t along g∘g).
    Hence g∘g∘χ = χ for all χ, which forces g∘g = id.

    **Prerequisite**: the universal property of the subobject classifier
    (pullback of t along classify m restores m), not yet in the class
    definition.  Currently a `sorry`. -/

/-! ## §1.91(10)  Minimal topos definition

  A category with binary products and equalizers (equivalently: binary
  products and pullbacks) and power objects, which is non-empty, has a
  terminator and hence is a topos (§1.91(10)). -/

/-- **§1.91(10)**: If a non-empty category has binary products, equalizers,
    and power objects, then it has a terminator (and is thus a topos). -/

  -- Construction: for any B, the equalizer of 1_{[B]} and Λ(M_{B,B})
  -- is a terminator, where M_{B,B} is the relation tabulated by B×B.
