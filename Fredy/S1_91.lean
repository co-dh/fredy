/-! ## §1.911  The contravariant relation functor Rel(−,B)

  For any category with pullbacks and any object B, `BinRel 𝒞 − B` is a
  contravariant set-valued functor: given f : A → A' and R : BinRel 𝒞 A' B,
  define f*(R) := relPullback f R.  The functoriality equation is
  g*(f*(R)) = (f ≫ g)*(R), i.e. relPullback is contravariantly functorial.

  The existence of a power-object [B] (§1.9, `HasPowerObject B`) is equivalent
  to this functor being representable: Rel(−,B) ≅ Hom(−,[B]).
  (The formalization of `BinRel`, `relPullback`, `HasPowerObject` and
  `IsUniversalRel` is in `Fredy.S1_9`.) -/

/-- **§1.911**: The relation pullback is contravariantly functorial:
    `relPullback g (relPullback f R) ≅ relPullback (f ≫ g) R`
    (as `RelHom` in both directions), where f : A'' → A', g : A' → A.

    Proof requires pullback pasting: the composite of two pullback squares is a
    pullback.  This is the same sorry as `invImg_comp` in S1_45.lean. -/

    (f : A'' ⟶ A') (g : A' ⟶ A) (R : BinRel 𝒞 A B) :

/-! ## §1.913  Subobjects as equalizers

  In a topos, every monic m : A' → A is the equalizer of its characteristic
  map χ_m : A → Ω and the constant-true map A → 1 → Ω.

  BECAUSE: A' → A is a pullback of t : 1 → Ω along χ_m.  In a category
  with a terminator, any pullback of a monic is an equalizer. -/

/-- **§1.913**: In a topos, each monic `m : A' → A` is the equalizer of its
    characteristic map `χ_m` and the constant-true map `A → 1 → Ω`.

    Stated as the universal property of the equalizer (a `Prop`, so the proof is
    choice-free): `m` equalizes the pair, and every `e` that equalizes factors
    uniquely through `m`.  Both parts come from the classifier pullback square
    (`classify_pullback`): `m` is the pullback of `t : 1 → Ω` along `χ_m`, and a
    pullback of `t` is exactly an equalizer of `χ_m` and `A → 1 → Ω`. -/

/-- **§1.913 (balanced)**: A topos is BALANCED — a morphism that is both monic
    and epic is an isomorphism.  Since `m` is the equalizer of `χ_m` and
    `A → 1 → Ω` (`monic_is_equalizer`), epicness collapses `χ_m = term ≫ true`,
    so `1_B` equalizes the pair and factors through `m`, splitting it; a split
    epic mono is iso. -/

/-- **§1.913**: In a topos, covers coincide with epimorphisms.
    Forward: every cover is epic (`cover_epi`, general).  Converse: an epic `f`
    has an epic image-monic `(image f).arr`, which is then iso by balancedness
    (`topos_mono_epi_iso`), so `image f` is entire and `f` is a cover. -/

/-! ## §1.914  Algebraic structure of Ω

  Every n-ary operation g : Ωⁿ → Ω induces an n-ary operation on subobjects of
  any object A: given A₁,…,Aₙ ⊆ A, define g(A₁,…,Aₙ) as the subobject whose
  characteristic map is g ∘ ⟨χ_{A₁},…,χ_{Aₙ}⟩.

  **Internal meet (conjunction)**: the binary operation ∧ : Ω×Ω → Ω is defined
  as the characteristic map of the monic (t,t) : 1 → Ω×Ω.  It satisfies
  A' ⊆ g(A₁,A₂) iff A' ⊆ A₁ and A' ⊆ A₂, i.e. g(A₁,A₂) = A₁ ∩ A₂.

  **Heyting double-arrow (implication)**: the binary operation ⇒ : Ω×Ω → Ω is
  the characteristic map of the monic (1,1) : Ω → Ω×Ω (the diagonal on Ω).
  It satisfies A' ⊆ g(A₁,A₂) iff A₁ ∩ A' = A₂ ∩ A', so g is the Heyting
  double-arrow (A₁ ⇒ A₂ = A₁ ↔ A₂) and ⊆(A) has a Heyting semi-lattice
  structure.  The Heyting single-arrow is x → y := x ⇒ (x ∧ y). -/

/-- The internal meet (conjunction) on Ω: the classifying map of the monic

/-! ## §1.919  Monic endomorphisms of Ω are involutions

  §1.919: Every monic endomorphism g : Ω → Ω is an involution (g² = id).
  BECAUSE: For monic g, define U = g(1_Ω) (the unique g-large subobject of 1)
  and V = 1 (since g is monic and g(V) = g(1) implies V = 1).  Then g²(A') =
  (A ↔ A×U) ∧ A×U = A itself for any A', so g² has the same large subobjects
  as the identity, hence g² = id. -/

/-- **§1.919**: Every monic endomorphism of Ω is an involution;
    that is, g : Ω → Ω monic implies g ≫ g = id.

    Proof sketch (Freyd §1.919): Define U as the unique g-large subobject of 1
    (where A' is g-large in A if χ_{A'} ≫ g = term_A ≫ true, meaning gA' = A).
    Since g is monic, g(V) = g(1_Ω) implies V = 1_Ω.  For any A, A is g²-large
    in itself, and the identity has the same property, so g² = id by extensionality.

    **Proof gap**: The argument requires Ω-extensionality: two maps f, h : A → Ω
    are equal iff they classify the same subobjects.  This follows from
    `classify_unique` applied to `true : 1 → Ω` (i.e. `true ≫ f = true ≫ h`
    would suffice), but requires explicitly constructing the pullback squares for
    g² and id to coincide — which needs the g-large/U/V argument from the book.
    The infrastructure (g-large predicate, U = g(1_Ω) as a subobject) is not yet
    formalized here. -/

/-! ## §1.91(10)  Minimal topos definition

  A category with binary products and equalizers (equivalently: binary products
  and pullbacks, or all finite non-empty limits) and a subobject classifier Ω,
  which is non-empty, already has a terminator and hence is a topos (§1.91(10)).

  CONSTRUCTION (Freyd): For objects A,B let M_{A,B} denote the relation tabulated
  by a product projection A×B → A (the "full" relation).  For any f,g : A' → A
  the equation f(M_{A,B}) = M_{A',B} shows that A M_{A,B} is a constant map.
  Hence Λ(M_{B,B}) : [B] → [B] is a constant idempotent endomorphism.
  For any A there is a map A → [B] (namely A M_{A,B}), so the equalizer of
  id_{[B]} and Λ(M_{B,B}) is a terminator.

  Note: `HasSubobjectClassifier` implies power-objects for the classifier
  object Ω = [1].  The full "has all power-objects" class is not yet
  formalized in this repo; we use `HasSubobjectClassifier` as the available
  proxy for the power-object hypothesis. -/

/-- **§1.91(10)**: A non-empty category with binary products, equalizers, and a
    subobject classifier has a terminator.

    `hne`: witness that 𝒞 is non-empty (an object exists).

    Currently `sorry`: the construction requires the full power-object
    machinery (Λ/ε adjunction for [B]), which goes beyond `HasSubobjectClassifier`. -/
