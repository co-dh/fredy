/-! ## §1.911  The contravariant relation functor Rel(−,B)

  For any category with pullbacks and any object B, `BinRel 𝒞 − B` is a
  contravariant set-valued functor: given f : A → A' and R : BinRel 𝒞 A' B,
  define f*(R) := relPullback f R.  The functoriality equation is
  g*(f*(R)) = (f ≫ g)*(R), i.e. relPullback is contravariantly functorial.

  The existence of a power-object [B] (§1.9, `HasPowerObject B`) is equivalent
  to this functor being representable: Rel(−,B) ≅ Hom(−,[B]).
  (The formalization of `BinRel`, `relPullback`, `HasPowerObject` and
  `IsUniversalRel` is in `Fredy.S1_9`.) -/

/-- **§1.911**: The relation pullback is contravariantly functorial:
    `relPullback f (relPullback g R) ≅ relPullback (f ≫ g) R`
    (as `RelHom` in both directions), where f : A'' → A', g : A' → A.

    Proved by hand from the pullback universal properties (pasting): the
    composite of the two pullback squares — one for `(g, R.colA)` and one for
    `(f, (relPullback g R).colA)` — is a pullback square for `(f ≫ g, R.colA)`.
    Each direction is a `HasPullback.lift` of the cone induced by the other
    side, with the colB legs matching by associativity. -/

/-! ## §1.913  Subobjects as equalizers

  In a topos, every monic m : A' → A is the equalizer of its characteristic
  map χ_m : A → Ω and the constant-true map A → 1 → Ω.

  BECAUSE: A' → A is a pullback of t : 1 → Ω along χ_m.  In a category
  with a terminator, any pullback of a monic is an equalizer. -/

/-- **§1.913**: In a topos, each monic `m : A' → A` is the equalizer of its
    characteristic map `χ_m` and the constant-true map `A → 1 → Ω`.

    Stated as the universal property of the equalizer (a `Prop`, so the proof is
    choice-free): `m` equalizes the pair, and every `e` that equalizes factors
    uniquely through `m`.  Both parts come from the classifier pullback square
    (`classify_pullback`): `m` is the pullback of `t : 1 → Ω` along `χ_m`, and a
    pullback of `t` is exactly an equalizer of `χ_m` and `A → 1 → Ω`. -/

/-- **§1.913 (balanced)**: A topos is BALANCED — a morphism that is both monic
    and epic is an isomorphism.  Since `m` is the equalizer of `χ_m` and
    `A → 1 → Ω` (`monic_is_equalizer`), epicness collapses `χ_m = term ≫ true`,
    so `1_B` equalizes the pair and factors through `m`, splitting it; a split
    epic mono is iso. -/

/-! ## §1.914  Algebraic structure of Ω

  Every n-ary operation g : Ωⁿ → Ω induces an n-ary operation on subobjects of
  any object A: given A₁,…,Aₙ ⊆ A, define g(A₁,…,Aₙ) as the subobject whose
  characteristic map is g ∘ ⟨χ_{A₁},…,χ_{Aₙ}⟩.

  **Internal meet (conjunction)**: the binary operation ∧ : Ω×Ω → Ω is defined
  as the characteristic map of the monic (t,t) : 1 → Ω×Ω.  It satisfies
  A' ⊆ g(A₁,A₂) iff A' ⊆ A₁ and A' ⊆ A₂, i.e. g(A₁,A₂) = A₁ ∩ A₂.

  **Heyting double-arrow (implication)**: the binary operation ⇒ : Ω×Ω → Ω is
  the characteristic map of the monic (1,1) : Ω → Ω×Ω (the diagonal on Ω).
  It satisfies A' ⊆ g(A₁,A₂) iff A₁ ∩ A' = A₂ ∩ A', so g is the Heyting
  double-arrow (A₁ ⇒ A₂ = A₁ ↔ A₂) and ⊆(A) has a Heyting semi-lattice
  structure.  The Heyting single-arrow is x → y := x ⇒ (x ∧ y). -/

/-! ## §1.919  Monic endomorphisms of Ω are involutions

  §1.919: Every monic endomorphism g : Ω → Ω is an involution (g² = id).
  BECAUSE: For monic g, define U = g(1_Ω) (the unique g-large subobject of 1)
  and V = 1 (since g is monic and g(V) = g(1) implies V = 1).  Then g²(A') =
  (A ↔ A×U) ∧ A×U = A itself for any A', so g² has the same large subobjects
  as the identity, hence g² = id. -/

/-- **§1.919**: Every monic endomorphism of Ω is an involution;
    that is, g : Ω → Ω monic implies g ≫ g = id.

    Proof sketch (Freyd §1.919): Define U as the unique g-large subobject of 1
    (where A' is g-large in A if χ_{A'} ≫ g = term_A ≫ true, meaning gA' = A).
    Since g is monic, g(V) = g(1_Ω) implies V = 1_Ω.  For any A, A is g²-large
    in itself, and the identity has the same property, so g² = id by extensionality.

    **Proof gap** (confirmed by deep proof-search): via the only available API
    (`classify_unique`, S1_9) the goal reduces to showing `t : 1 → Ω` is the
    pullback of `t` along `g ≫ g` (i.e. `g²` classifies the maximal subobject of
    Ω — "A is g²-large in itself").  This needs three not-yet-formalized pieces:
    (1) `classify`-iso-invariance (easy from `classify_unique`); (2) the
    CHARACTERIZING lemmas for `omegaMeet`/`heytingDoubleArrow` (defined below but
    with no universal property) — e.g. the pullback of `t` along
    `⟨χ₁,χ₂⟩ ≫ omegaMeet` ≅ `Sub.inter A₁ A₂` (S1_45) — the substantive missing
    bridge; (3) operation-extensionality, which is STRICTLY stronger than
    `classify_unique` and needs the full `Sub(−) ≅ Hom(−,Ω)` bijection wired to
    `classify`.  Faithful sorry; see S1_91.md for the sharpened blocker. -/

/-! ## §1.91(10)  Minimal topos definition

  A category with binary products and equalizers (equivalently: binary products
  and pullbacks, or all finite non-empty limits) and a subobject classifier Ω,
  which is non-empty, already has a terminator and hence is a topos (§1.91(10)).

  CONSTRUCTION (Freyd): For objects A,B let M_{A,B} denote the relation tabulated
  by a product projection A×B → A (the "full" relation).  For any f,g : A' → A
  the equation f(M_{A,B}) = M_{A',B} shows that A M_{A,B} is a constant map.
  Hence Λ(M_{B,B}) : [B] → [B] is a constant idempotent endomorphism.
  For any A there is a map A → [B] (namely A M_{A,B}), so the equalizer of
  id_{[B]} and Λ(M_{B,B}) is a terminator.

  Note: `HasSubobjectClassifier` implies power-objects for the classifier
  object Ω = [1].  The full "has all power-objects" class is not yet
  formalized in this repo; we use `HasSubobjectClassifier` as the available
  proxy for the power-object hypothesis. -/

/-- **§1.91(10)**: A non-empty category with binary products, equalizers, and a
    subobject classifier has a terminator.

    `hne`: witness that 𝒞 is non-empty (an object exists).

    NOTE: `HasSubobjectClassifier` extends `HasTerminal` (S1_9, line 142), so the result
    is trivially discharged by `HasSubobjectClassifier.toHasTerminal`.  This does NOT
    reproduce Freyd's construction — which builds the terminator as the equalizer of
    `id_{[B]}` and the constant idempotent `Λ(M_{B,B}) : [B] → [B]` for any B — because
    that needs `HasPowerObject B` for ALL B plus the Λ/ε classify-bijection at each [B],
    neither of which is formalized here.  The `hne` hypothesis and `[HasBinaryProducts]`,
    `[HasEqualizers]` are structurally unused; they are kept to match the book's hypotheses.
