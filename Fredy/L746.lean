  LeetCode 746 — Min Cost Climbing Stairs — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a non-empty array of step costs `cost[0],…,cost[n-1]`, you may start the climb at
  index 0 or index 1 (landing on either is free of any *entry* cost beyond the step's own cost),
  and from any step you may climb 1 or 2 steps. The goal is the minimum total cost of some valid
  climb that lands PAST the last step (index `n`). `minCost[i]` = cheapest cost to STAND ON step
  `i` = `cost[i] + min(minCost[i-1], minCost[i-2])`, seeded by `minCost[0] = cost[0]` and a free
  virtual pad `minCost[-1] = 0` BEFORE the array (encoding "start at index 1 for free"). Answer =
  `min(minCost[n-1], minCost[n-2])` — you may step off from either of the last two steps.

  Same recipe as `Fredy/L198.lean` (see `Fredy/leetcode.md`, skill S4), the paired-state DP
  template FLIPPED to `min`:

  1. **Data** — `SnocList ℤ ℤ` (`Fredy.A6_SnocList`); `wrap x` = a single step of cost `x`, `snoc
     xs p` appends a step of cost `p`.

  2. **Program** — the fold state `(reachHere, reachPrev)` = (cheapest cost to stand on the LAST
     processed step, cheapest cost to stand on the one BEFORE it). Algebra
     `[ x ↦ (x, 0), ((reachHere,reachPrev),p) ↦ (p + min reachHere reachPrev, reachHere) ]`.
     `solveFn xs = min (foldFn xs).1 (foldFn xs).2` (step off from either of the last two steps).

  3. **Specification** — two mutually-referencing relations, split by "does the climb land ON
     `xs`'s last step, or the one before it?": `costHere xs v` — `v` is the cost of a valid climb
     landing on `xs`'s last step; `costPrev xs v` — `v` is the cost of a valid climb landing on the
     step BEFORE `xs`'s last step (for a singleton `xs` this is the free virtual pad, `v = 0`).
     `costOf xs v = costHere xs v ∨ costPrev xs v` is the relation of ALL achievable "land near the
     end" costs. LeetCode 746 asks for its `≤`-MINIMUM, `min (≤) · Λ costOf`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that minimum: it returns an achievable cost (part
     of `solve_correct`, giving `solve ⊑ spec`) and is `≤` every achievable cost (the other part —
     domination flips to `≤`, mirroring `L198`'s `≥` for `max`). Together this is `solve = min (≤)
     · Λ costOf`, evaluated pointwise in the Set model.

   before it?"  `costHere xs v`: `v` is the cost of a valid climb landing on `xs`'s last step
   (reached by a 1- or 2-step hop from a climb landing on the last, resp. second-to-last, step of
   the shorter prefix). `costPrev xs v`: `v` is the cost of a valid climb landing on the step
   BEFORE `xs`'s last step — for a singleton `xs` there is no such step, so this is the free
   virtual pad before the array (`v = 0`, encoding "start at index 1"); otherwise it is exactly a
   `costHere`-climb of the shorter prefix. -/
