  Bird & de Moor, *Algebra of Programming* §9.2  The string edit problem (book pp. 225-229).

  Compute a minimum-cost edit sequence (`mle`) transforming one list into another — the classic
  edit-distance dynamic program.  The specification is `min R · Λ(edits)` where the edit relation is
  built by unfolding both strings (copy / insert / delete / change) and `R` orders by total cost.
  This is exactly the DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING setting of §9.1: the algebra `h` (an edit step) is
  monotonic on the transitive cost order `R`, and Theorem 9.1 gives the DP recursion refining the
  exhaustive search.  (B&dM additionally thin by `thin(Q₁+Q₂)` — a coproduct-split thinning needing
  Proposition 9.1, dropped from A9_1; here we give the underlying DP result.)  A direct instance of
  `A9_1.dynamic_programming`; the concrete two-list coalgebra and cost are the problem-specific detail.
