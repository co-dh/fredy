  LeetCode 271 — Encode and Decode Strings — DERIVED as an ALGEBRA-OF-PROGRAMMING pair:
  the length-prefix ENCODER emerges as a `ConsList` CATAMORPHISM, its DECODER as a measured
  recursive-coalgebra HYLOMORPHISM, and together they satisfy a SECTION–RETRACTION identity.

  `Fredy/L271.lean` hand-writes `encode` (a `List.flatMap` length-prefix listing) and `decodeFn`
  (a FUELLED length-prefix parser) and proves the round-trip `decodeFn (encode strs) = some strs`.
  Here neither program is re-written; each is PRODUCED by a reusable uniqueness law and its
  correctness is REUSED from `L271.lean`.

  * **ENCODE — a catamorphism.**  `encode strs = strs.flatMap encode1` is the front-to-back fold of
    the initial algebra `ConsList Unit (List Int)` with carrier `C := List Int`, base `encG _ := []`
    and step `encSt s acc := encode1 s ++ acc` (length-prefix the head block, prepend to the encoded
    tail).  `CL.consFold_unique` emits `graph encodeCL = CL.cataR (CL.consScalarAlg encG encSt)`
    (`encode_emerges`).  Block-append fires once per block, so encode is O(N) total.

  * **DECODE — a hylomorphism.**  The parser is the DUAL of a fold: a recursive coalgebra
    `decC : List Int → Unit ⊕ (List Int × List Int)` (leaf `.inl ()` at the empty token list;
    otherwise read the head length `n` and split off the next `n.toNat` tokens as one block, recurse
    on the drop), whose unfolding is well-founded via the token-count measure `decμ := length`
    (`decdec`: the drop is strictly shorter — the length prefix consumed is ≥ 1 token).  Re-folded
    with algebra base `decG _ := []`, step `decSt block acc := block :: acc`, it is exactly the
    hand-written `decodeHylo`; `Hylo.hyloFold_unique` emits
    `graph decodeHylo = Hylo.hyloR decC decμ decdec decG decSt` (`decode_emerges`).  Each token is
    `take`/`drop`ped once, so decode is O(N) — the explicit fuel of `L271.decodeFn` is GONE, replaced
    by the measure.

  * **Correctness — SECTION–RETRACTION, reused not re-proved.**  `decodeFuel_some_hylo` bridges the
    two decoders (whenever the fuelled parser succeeds, the hylomorphism returns the same list), so
    `L271.round_trip` transfers verbatim to `decode_hylo_round_trip : decodeHylo (encode strs) = strs`.
    In `Rel(Set)` this is `graph encode ≫ graph decodeHylo = id` (`section_retraction_derived`):
    `encode` is a section of the decoder `decodeHylo` its retraction.
