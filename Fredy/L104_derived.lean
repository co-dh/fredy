  LeetCode 104 — Maximum Depth of Binary Tree — DERIVED by extremum fusion (the GREEDY THEOREM),
  the FIRST tree derivation in the Algebra-of-Programming track.

  `Fredy.L104` writes the depth fold `[ () ↦ 0,  (dl,_,dr) ↦ 1 + imax dl dr ]` down and then verifies
  it against the spec `pathLen`.  HERE we do the opposite: we START from the extremum specification
  `maxRel (≤) · Λ pathLen` (the ≤-maximum of the achievable root-to-`nil` path lengths) and let the
  max-fold step `1 + imax dl dr` EMERGE as the unique monotone map that refines the greedy choice —
  it is not written first.

  The route (B&dM §7.2 greedy theorem, `A7_4_Horner.greedy_max_of_refinement`):

  * `S` — the NONDETERMINISTIC generator `[ () ↦ {0},  (rl,_,rr) ↦ {rl+1, rr+1} ]`; its
    catamorphism `⦇S⦈` is exactly `pathLen` (bridge `cataTreeFold_S`), the set of achievable path
    lengths.
  * `alg` (= `L104.alg`, the deterministic depth fold) is shown to (a) be MONOTONE on the reverse-`≤`
    order `R x y := y ≤ x` (`alg_mono`, from `imax` monotone) and (b) REFINE the greedy choice
    `A S ≫ maxRel R` (`alg_refines`: `alg ⊑ S` — every folded value is generatable — AND
    `S° ≫ alg ⊑ R°` — the folded value dominates every generatable value; both from `imax_eq_or`
    and `imax_ge_left/right`).  These two facts FORCE the node step to be `1 + imax dl dr`: it is the
    only monotone map that both lands in `{dl+1, dr+1}` and dominates it.
  * The greedy theorem then places `⦇alg⦈` inside the Pareto frontier `A ⦇S⦈ ≫ maxRel R`; the
    TreeBin bridge `cataR_eq_relCata` transports this from the abstract `relCata` to the structural
    `cataR`, and reading off the single greedy conclusion (membership + maximality) gives BOTH halves
    of correctness — achievability and domination — WITHOUT ever invoking `L104.pathLen_depth` /
    `pathLen_le_depth`.

  Mathlib-free.  Axioms of the headline `depth_derived_correct` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
  Quot.sound}; the `Classical.choice` is the honest price of `greedy_max_of_refinement` / `relCata`'s
  universal property.

/-! ## The specification, as an extremum

`R` is the REVERSE `≤` so that `maxRel R` is the numeric maximum; `S` is the nondeterministic
generator whose catamorphism enumerates the achievable path lengths. -/

/-- Reverse `≤` on `ℕ`: `R x y := y ≤ x`, so `maxRel R` picks the numerically LARGEST member. -/
def R : (dNat : RelSet.{0}) ⟶ (dNat : RelSet.{0}) := fun x y => y ≤ x

/-- The nondeterministic generator `[ () ↦ {0},  (rl,_,rr) ↦ {rl+1, rr+1} ] : F(ℕ) → ℕ` — "extend
    a child's path by one".  Its catamorphism is exactly `pathLen` (see `cataTreeFold_S`). -/
def S : TFobj L (dNat : RelSet.{0}) ⟶ (dNat : RelSet.{0}) := fun u n => match u with
  | Sum.inl _           => n = 0
  | Sum.inr (rl, _, rr) => n = rl + 1 ∨ n = rr + 1

/-! ## Bridge: `⦇S⦈ = pathLen` (the generator computes the spec) -/

/-- Every tree has at least one achievable path length (the leftmost path). -/

/-- **The generator IS the spec**: the structural catamorphism of `S` relates a tree to `n` exactly
    when `n` is an achievable root-to-`nil` path length.  Tree analogue of the `gen_spec`/`spec_gen`
    characterisation in `A7_4_Horner.horner_correct`. -/

/-- The depth fold `alg` is MONOTONE on `R`: `imax` is monotone, so a `≤`-larger pair of child
    depths yields a `≤`-larger node depth (mirrored through the reverse order `R`). -/

/-- The depth fold `alg` REFINES the greedy choice `A S ≫ maxRel R`.  Via `le_A_comp_maxRel_iff` this
    is two facts: `alg ⊑ S` (the folded value `1 + imax rl rr` is one of `{rl+1, rr+1}`, by
    `imax_eq_or`) and `S° ≫ alg ⊑ R°` (the folded value dominates every generatable value, by
    `imax_ge_left`/`imax_ge_right`).  These two force the node step to equal `1 + imax rl rr`. -/

/-! ## The derivation: `1 + imax dl dr` emerges as the greedy choice -/

/-- **LeetCode 104, derived by extremum fusion.**  `depthFn t` is an achievable path length AND is
    the `≤`-greatest achievable path length — the SAME statement as `L104.solve_correct`, but here
    DERIVED: the load-bearing first line is the greedy theorem `greedy_max_of_refinement`, which
    fuses the maximum of the nondeterministic generator `S` into the deterministic fold `alg` whose
    node step `1 + imax dl dr` is forced (via `alg_mono` + `alg_refines`) as the unique monotone map
    refining the greedy choice.  No appeal to `pathLen_depth`/`pathLen_le_depth`. -/
