  The **tupling law** for BINARY-TREE catamorphisms — the tree-shaped companion of
  `Fredy.A6_8_Tupling`'s snoc-list `SL.tupling`.

  A function `h : Tree A → C₁ × C₂` obeying the FIRST-ORDER lockstep recursion
    `h nil          = g`
    `h (node l a r) = step (h l) a (h r)`
  is, by the initial-algebra universal property (uniqueness of the catamorphism), EXACTLY the
  catamorphism `⦇[g, step]⦈` of the algebra `[g, step]`.  When the carrier is a PRODUCT `C₁ × C₂`
  this is the tupling / linearization move for trees: to compute a node's answer from an AUXILIARY
  quantity over its subtrees (e.g. a height), carry a tuple and run a SINGLE bottom-up fold instead
  of recomputing the auxiliary at every node.  The pair-carrying tree fold is then not written by
  hand and verified — it is PRODUCED by this law from the base `g` and step `step`, both read off the
  problem's recurrence.  `Fredy/L110_derived.lean` (Balanced Binary Tree) and
  `Fredy/L543_derived.lean` (Diameter) derive their `(height, answer)` folds this way.

  The `nil` constructor of `Tree A` carries no data (it is the `1` summand of `F X = 1 + X×A×X`), so
  the base is a VALUE `g : C₁ × C₂` — the tree analogue of the snoc-list `wrap`'s `g : L → C₁ × C₂`.
  Reuses the whole `A6_TreeBin` engine (`cataR`, `cataTreeFold`, `cataTreeFold_nil`,
  `cataTreeFold_node`) with ZERO new engine code.  Mathlib-free.

/-- Emergent product-algebra from base `g : C₁ × C₂` and step `step : C₁×C₂ → A → C₁×C₂ → C₁×C₂`.
    This is the algebra `[g, step] : F(C₁×C₂) → C₁×C₂` whose catamorphism the tupling law identifies
    with the lockstep recursion; it is the graph of the case split, hence a `Map`.  The `Sum.inl`
    (`nil`) summand carries no label, so it maps to the fixed base `g`; the `Sum.inr` (`node`) summand
    carries `(pl, a, pr)` — the two subtree results and the node label — and maps by `step`. -/

/-- **The tree tupling law.**  A function `h` solving the first-order lockstep tree recursion
    `h nil = g`, `h (node l a r) = step (h l) a (h r)` IS the catamorphism of `treePairAlg g step`.
    Proof: catamorphism uniqueness — `graph h` and `cataR (treePairAlg g step)` satisfy the SAME
    structural recursion, so a single induction on `Tree A` identifies them.  The `node` case now has
    TWO recursive children, hence TWO induction hypotheses `ihl`/`ihr`, mirroring `SL.tupling`'s
    single-IH `snoc` case but pinning BOTH subtree results from the two IHs. -/

    the first slot of the emergent pair fold: the graph of `t ↦ (h t).1` is the catamorphism of
    `treePairAlg g step` followed by the first projection.  (The Diameter/Balanced derivations read
    off the SECOND slot instead, done inline there; this is the symmetric convenience lemma for the
    first, matching `SL.tupling_fst`.) -/
