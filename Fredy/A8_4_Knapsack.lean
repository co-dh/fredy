  Bird & de Moor, *Algebra of Programming* §8.4  The knapsack problem (book pp. 205-206) —
  the standard example of BINARY THINNING.

  Pack items of greatest total value into a knapsack of capacity `w`, from a `list Item`.  Selections
  are modelled as subsequences (`subseq = ⦇[nil,cons] ∪ [nil,outr]⦈`); `value = sum·list val`,
  `weight = sum·list wt`.  The specification is `knapsack w ⊆ min R·Λ(within w · subseq)` with
  `R = value°·geq·value` (order by descending value) and `within w x = (weight x ≤ w)`.  B&dM refine
  it by THINNING with the preorder `Q = R ∩ (weight°·leq·weight)` (sort by value, break ties by
  weight): the within-`w` selection algebra `S` is monotonic on `Q°` (the "easy to prove" fact),
  and — the cons-list base functor being linear — the thinning theorem applies, giving the
  binary-thinning program.  The refinement is exactly the thinning theorem (`A8_1.thinning_min`).

/-- **§8.4 (B&dM pp.205-206)**: the knapsack problem is solved by BINARY THINNING.  With the
    subsequence-selection algebra `S`, the descending-value order `R`, and the thinning preorder
    `Q = R ∩ (weight-order)`, once `S` is monotonic on `Q°` the thinning DP
    `⦇thin Q · Λ(S·F∈)⦈ · min R` refines the specification `min R·Λ⦇S⦈ = min R·Λ(within w·subseq)`.
    A direct instance of the thinning theorem `A8_1.thinning_min` (with `Q`, `R`, `S`, and the
    monotonicity `hmono` supplied concretely by the knapsack data, per B&dM's derivation). -/
