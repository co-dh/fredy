  A GENUINE calculational Algebra-of-Programming derivation, in the style of Bird & de Moor.

  The point of this file is METHODOLOGICAL: a functional program is CALCULATED from a
  relational/algebraic SPEC, so that the program EMERGES as the endpoint of a chain of
  allegory-law steps — it is NOT written first and verified afterwards.  Two kinds of
  derivation are demonstrated over snoc-lists `SnocList Unit Int` (the base engine is
  `Fredy.A6_SnocList`), answering "does AoP derivation extend beyond the three optimisation
  theorems (greedy / thinning / dynamic-programming)?":

  ## Part 1 — the PROGRAM emerges from the homomorphism spec (universal property)
  The Horner value function `value` is SPECIFIED, not defined, as: "the unique relation `h`
  making the square `α ≫ h = F h ≫ φ` commute" (an `F`-algebra homomorphism from the initial
  algebra to the target algebra `φ`).  The Eilenberg–Wright universal property `relCata_UP`
  (A5_5) pins `h = relCata φ`; the SnocList bridge `cataR_eq_relCata` (A6_SnocList) rewrites
  that to the structural fold `cataR φ = cataFold φ`; and `cataFold`'s two defining equations
  then DELIVER the recursive program
      value (wrap _)      = 0
      value (snoc xs d)   = base * value xs + d           -- Horner's rule
  as theorems `value_wrap` / `value_snoc`, not as a definition.  (The target algebra `φ` was
  given in the spec; what emerges is the runnable recursion.)

  ## Part 2 — a reusable FOLD-FUSION law, derived purely from the universal property
  `cata_fusion` : `φ ≫ h = F h ≫ ψ  →  cata φ ≫ h = cata ψ`.  Proved abstractly from
  `relCata_cancel` + functoriality — one `calc` chain, each step one named allegory law.

  ## Part 3 — the ALGEBRA emerges by SOLVING the fusion equation
  Post-composing `value` with "multiply by `k`" and SOLVING the fusion condition
  `φ_val ≫ (k·) = F(k·) ≫ ψ` for `ψ` yields a NEW algebra
      ψ = [ _ ↦ 0 ,  (a,d) ↦ base * a + k * d ]                     -- a multiply-accumulate
  (the digit weight `k` is pushed onto the *new* digit, not onto the whole running value).
  Feeding that `ψ` back through the universal property gives a fresh program `scaleValue`.
  Here it is the ALGEBRA, not merely the recursion, that is the OUTPUT of the calculation.

  Mathlib-free.  Axioms ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; `Classical.choice` is
  inherited from `relCata`'s universal property (the same honest price A6_6/A7_4 pay).

    ## Part 1 — Horner's `value` derived from its homomorphism spec
    ############################################################################ -/

/-- The TARGET algebra of the specification, as an ordinary function
    `F Int → Int` (`F X = Unit + X × Int`): the empty list denotes `0`, and pushing a digit
    `d` onto a running value `a` denotes `base * a + d`.  This is the only thing "posited";
    the program is calculated from it. -/

  | Sum.inl _ => 0
  | Sum.inr p => base * p.1 + p.2

/-- **The SPEC.**  `h` is a *value-homomorphism* at `base` when the initial-algebra square
    commutes: `α ≫ h = F h ≫ graph (valAlg base)`, i.e. `h` is an `F`-algebra homomorphism
    from the initial algebra `α = [wrap, snoc]` to the algebra `valAlg base`.  Nothing here
    says `h` is a fold. -/
def IsValueHom (base : Int) (h : dSL Unit Int ⟶ (⟨Int⟩ : RelSet.{0})) : Prop :=
  (initial Unit Int).α ≫ h = (F Unit Int).map h ≫ graph (valAlg base)

/-- **Derivation step (universal property).**  Being a value-homomorphism is EQUIVALENT to
    being the catamorphism of `valAlg base`.  Proof = the Eilenberg–Wright universal property
    `relCata_UP` (A5_5) followed by the SnocList bridge `cataR_eq_relCata` (A6_SnocList).  No
    induction, no guessing: the fold is FORCED by the spec. -/

    the value of the empty list is `0`.  Holds definitionally. -/
theorem value_wrap (base : Int) (u : Unit) (r : Int) :
    cataR (graph (valAlg base)) (SnocList.wrap u) r ↔ r = 0 := Iff.rfl

/-- **Program emerges (step case).**  `cataFold`'s `snoc` equation instantiated at `valAlg`:
    pushing a digit `d` multiplies the running value by `base` and adds `d` — Horner's rule.
    Holds definitionally. -/

/-- **The derivation, packaged.**  The unique value-homomorphism at `base` is exactly the
    graph of the calculated program `value base`.  Read left-to-right: the abstract spec
    "commuting square" is met by one and only one relation, and it is the Horner program. -/

    whose only closed form (in the free variable `k·a`) is `(a', d) ↦ base·a' + k·d`; on `wrap`,
    `ψ _ = k·0 = 0`.  `scale_fusion_cond` below is the machine-checked verification that this
    `ψ` really solves the equation (so fold fusion fires) — the derivation content is the SOLVING,
    Lean confirms the solution.  Note the weight `k` lands on the *new* digit `d`, not on the
    whole running value: the algebra genuinely differs from `valAlg`. -/
