  §2.218 / §1.635 — assembling a FAMILY of allegory representations into the allegory POWER.

  Freyd's §1.635 represents a (capital positive pre-logos / its allegory) in a POWER of the allegory
  of sets, `Rel(Set)^I`, by the FAMILY of stalk functors `{Rel(T_F̂)}` over all ultra-filters `F̂`.
  The representation is FAITHFUL not because any single stalk reflects isos, but because the family is
  COLLECTIVELY faithful (some `F̂` separates any two distinct relations — Freyd's ultra-filter
  construction, `exists_ultrafilter_excluding`).

  This file provides the abstract glue: a family `I → AllegoryFunctor 𝒜 ℬ` assembles, pointwise, into
  one `AllegoryFunctor 𝒜 (PowerObj I ℬ)` (`familyAllegoryHom`), which is FAITHFUL exactly when the
  family is jointly faithful (`familyAllegoryHom_faithful`).  The stalk-family instance then needs only
  the joint faithfulness, which is the §1.635 collective-faithfulness statement — NOT single-stalk
  iso-reflection. -/
