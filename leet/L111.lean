  LeetCode 111 — Minimum Depth of Binary Tree — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: the minimum number of nodes on a shortest ROOT-TO-LEAF path (a leaf is a node with NO
  children).  Mirrors `leet/L104.lean` (Maximum Depth) with `imax` swapped for `imin` — but with
  a genuine extra case: a node with exactly ONE child is not a leaf, so the fold may NOT take
  `min(childDepth, 0)` at such a node — it must take the depth of the present child alone.

  1. **Data** — `Tree Int` (`AOP.A6_TreeBin`), `nil` an empty leaf slot, `node l a r` an
     `Int`-labelled internal node.

  2. **Program** — `minDepthFn`: `nil ↦ 0`; a `node` with both children `nil` (a genuine leaf)
     `↦ 1`; a node with exactly one `nil` child `↦ 1 + (depth of the present child)`; a node with
     both children present `↦ 1 + min(depth l, depth r)`.  Packaged as `solve := graph minDepthFn`.

  3. **Specification** — `IsRLDepth t d`: some root-to-leaf path in `t` has exactly `d` nodes
     (`leaf` = a single node with no children; `left`/`right` step down a NON-nil child).  For a
     non-empty tree, `minDepthFn` is the MINIMUM such `d`.

  4. **Correctness** — achievability (`minDepthFn t` is itself an `IsRLDepth` value, for
     `t ≠ nil`) and domination (`minDepthFn t` is `≤` every `IsRLDepth` value) — the min-form of
     L104's max-extremum shape.
