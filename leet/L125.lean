  LeetCode 125 — Valid Palindrome — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a sequence of characters, decide whether it reads the same forwards and
  backwards.  (The real LeetCode problem also filters to alphanumeric characters and case-folds
  before comparing; that is a routine pre-pass on the input list and is SKIPPED here — we solve
  the core decision "is this sequence a palindrome?", chars as `Int`.)

  Same data/program recipe as `leet/L217.lean` (`AOP.A6_SnocList`, `Fredy/leetcode.md` S0/S5):
  this is a DECISION problem, so correctness is a plain `iff`, not a refinement+domination
  extremum.

  1. **Data** — the sequence is the initial algebra `SnocList Int Int` (§A6_SnocList).

  2. **Program** — `toList : SnocList Int Int → List Int` unpacks the (right-append) `SnocList`
     into a plain `List Int`, giving symmetric front/back access; `palinFn xs` then decides
     `toList xs = (toList xs).reverse` via `List Int`'s `DecidableEq`.

  3. **Specification** — `IsPalin xs : Prop := toList xs = (toList xs).reverse` ("the sequence
     reads the same both ways"), stated directly in terms of `List.reverse` (not re-derived
     structurally), so the bridge to `palinFn` is honest.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve_correct : palinFn xs = true ↔ IsPalin xs` is immediate from
     `decide_eq_true_eq`; the real content is `toList`'s two equation lemmas.
