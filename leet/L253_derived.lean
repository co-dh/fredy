  LeetCode 253 — Meeting Rooms II — DERIVED as a `Nat` max-fold catamorphism.

  `leet/L253.lean` computes `roomsFn ivs := (ivs.map (fun iv => countCover ivs iv.1)).foldr nmax 0`
  by hand: a plain `List.map` + `List.foldr` composite.  This file RESHAPES the same computation onto
  the canonical cons-list initial algebra `ConsList Unit (Int × Int)` (`Freyd.Alg.RelSet.CL.ofList`)
  and shows the fold EMERGES from the general-carrier law `CL.consFold_unique` — the same recipe as
  `leet/L1.lean`'s hash scan, with carrier `C := Nat`.

  The key point, exactly as in `leet/L1.lean` (where `target` is fixed for the whole scan): the step
  needs `countCover ivs iv.1` — "how many meetings cover THIS meeting's own start" — which reads the
  WHOLE interval list `ivs`, not just the folded-so-far prefix.  So `ivs` is carried as a FIXED
  parameter of the base/step (never threaded through the recursion), exactly like `leet/L1.lean`'s
  `target`; `countCover` itself is `List.filter |>.length`, i.e. already a fold of its own (a
  `foldr`-over-`Bool`-test count) — reused verbatim from `L253.lean`, not re-derived, since
  `consFold_unique` only asks for `countCover`'s VALUE at each step, not its internal recursion.

  1. **The program EMERGES.**  Base `g ivs _ = 0` (empty suffix contributes nothing to the max); step
     `st ivs iv acc = nmax (countCover ivs iv.1) acc` (`nmax` the current interval's OWN coverage
     count against the folded tail's max).  Feeding these to `CL.consFold_unique` produces the fold as
     `cataR (consScalarAlg (g ivs) (st ivs))` — `rooms_emerges` — never hand-written.

  2. **Bridge.**  `foldCL_ofList` shows the reshaped fold agrees with `LC253.roomsFn`'s `map`+`foldr`
     composite on ANY converted list, by structural induction; instantiating at `xs := ivs` (the fold
     runs over the SAME list it reads as a fixed parameter) gives `derivedSolve_eq : derivedSolve ivs =
     LC253.roomsFn ivs`.

  3. **Correctness is REUSED**, not re-proved: `LC253.rooms_correct` (achievability `rooms_achievable`
     + domination `rooms_dominates`) is already the honest S0 extremum pair, so the headline is stated
     as the actual morphism equation `RelSet.eq_A_comp_maxRel` (`AOP/A7_4_Horner.lean`) —
     `derivedSolve = A spec ≫ maxRel D` for the `≤`-preference order `D w z := z ≤ w`, `spec ivs v :=
     ∃ t, countCover ivs t = v` — instead of only a pointwise restatement.

  4. **Complexity.**  This is the SAME `O(n²)` algorithm as `L253.lean` (`n` = `ivs.length`): the fold
     visits each of the `n` interval-starts once, and each step's `countCover ivs iv.1` filters the
     WHOLE `n`-length list — `n` steps × `O(n)` per step.  The event-sort sweep (sort `2n` start/end
     events, scan with a running counter, `O(n log n)`) is a DIFFERENT algorithm — no sort, no event
     list, no running counter here — and is out of scope for this derivation.

  Mathlib-free (Lean core + `Freyd.*` only); headline axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}.

/-- **Honest headline (§7.5 `max (≤)·Λ spec`)**: `derivedSolve` is exactly the morphism
    `A spec ≫ maxRel D` for the `≤`-preference order `D w z := z ≤ w` — not merely pointwise.
    Bundles the emerged fold (`rooms_emerges`) with the reused extremum correctness. -/
