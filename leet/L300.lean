  LeetCode 300 — Longest Increasing Subsequence — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a non-empty array of integers `x₀,…,x_{n-1}`, find the length of the longest
  STRICTLY increasing subsequence (elements need not be contiguous, but must keep their relative
  order and strictly increase in value).

  Same recipe as `leet/L53.lean` / `leet/L198.lean` (see `Fredy/leetcode.md`, skill S0/S1/S4):

  1. **Data** — the array is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ`
     (`AOP.A6_SnocList`); `wrap x` is a single-element array, `snoc xs p` appends an element.

  2. **Program** — the classic O(n²) DP: carry a `List (ℤ × ℕ)` of `(value, lisLenEndingThere)`
     pairs for every element seen so far, plus the running best.  For a new element `p`,
     `lisEnd records p := 1 + bestBelow records p` where `bestBelow` is the max recorded length
     among entries whose value is `< p` (`0` if none); the record `(p, lisEnd records p)` is
     appended and the running best is `nmax best (lisEnd records p)`.  We package it as a `Map`
     `solve : Arr ⟶ ℕ` in `Rel(Set)` and prove it *is* the catamorphism of that algebra followed
     by the second projection (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — a two-layer relation in the L53/L198 style: `lastEnd xs p v k` — `v = p`
     and `k` is the length of a strictly increasing subsequence of `snoc xs p` that ends AT the
     new last element `p` (either `p` alone, or an achievable subsequence of `xs` ending at some
     value `< p`, extended by `p`).  `anyEnd xs v k` — `k` is the length of a strictly increasing
     subsequence of `xs` ending (ANYWHERE) at value `v`: either achievable within the prefix, or
     (when `xs = snoc xs' p`) achieved by `lastEnd xs' p`.  `isSubseqInc xs k := ∃ v, anyEnd xs v
     k` is the LeetCode spec: `k` is the length of SOME strictly increasing subsequence of `xs`.
     LeetCode 300 asks for its `≤`-maximum, `max (≤) · Λ isSubseqInc`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum: it returns an achievable
     subsequence length (`solve_achievable`, giving `solve ⊑ spec`) and dominates every achievable
     subsequence length (`domination`).  Together (`solve_correct`) this is
     `solve = max (≤) · Λ isSubseqInc`, evaluated pointwise in the Set model.  The bridge between
     the DP fold's `records` list and the `anyEnd`/`lastEnd` spec is carried by two structural
     invariants: `records_sound` (every recorded pair is an achievable ending) and
     `records_complete` (every achievable ending is dominated by some recorded pair) — the
     records-carrying analogue of L53's `foldFn_fst_dominates`/`foldFn_fst_is_suffix`.
