  LeetCode 136 — Single Number — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM: an XOR-CANCELLATION fold.

  Problem: given a non-empty list of `Nat`s in which every value appears exactly twice except one,
  which appears exactly once, return that one value.

  This reuses the `L191` recipe (count-catamorphism, state-is-answer, no trailing projection) but
  swaps the fold's monoid: instead of `Nat`-addition counting `true` bits, `xorFn` XORs (`^^^`)
  every element together. `Nat.xor` makes `(Nat, ^^^, 0)` a commutative group in which every
  element is its own inverse (`x ^^^ x = 0`, `Nat.xor_self`), so a value paired with itself cancels
  to `0` regardless of what else is folded around it (`Nat.xor_assoc`) — the running fold "forgets"
  every value that occurs an even number of times and keeps exactly the odd one out.

  1. **Data** — a list is `Nums := dSL Nat Nat` (`A6_SnocList`'s engine, leaf type = element type =
     `Nat`; `wrap x` a singleton, `snoc xs p` appends one more value).

  2. **Program** — `xorFn` folds `Nat.xor` over every element by structural recursion, packaged as
     `solve : Nums ⟶ dNat := graph solveFn` and proved equal to `cataR alg` (`solve_eq_cata`), as in
     `L191`: the fold's running state IS the answer, no trailing projection.

  3. **Specification with precondition** — `PairedExceptOne xs m` (inductive): `xs` is built from a
     `wrap m` base by repeatedly appending a matched pair (`snoc (snoc xs p) p`), i.e. `xs`'s
     multiset is `m` plus some elements each occurring an even number of times, and `m` is the
     unique odd-count element. `solve_correct` shows `solveFn xs = m` under this hypothesis.

     SCOPE NOTE (the task's sanctioned fallback, taken here): `PairedExceptOne` builds `xs` with
     `m` as the very FIRST element and every pair appended immediately (adjacently) after it; it
     does NOT allow the paired elements and the singleton `m` to be freely interleaved in an
     arbitrary order — that would need a hand-rolled multiset/permutation theory (no
     `Multiset`/`List.Perm`, mathlib-free) to convert an arbitrary count-parity hypothesis into
     canonical form, which is the genuinely heavy part of this problem. `Nat.xor` itself IS already
     order-independent (commutative + associative, see `xorFn_pair_cancel`); only the SPEC's shape
     — not the algorithm or the cancellation algebra — is scoped down.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve_correct : PairedExceptOne xs m → solveFn xs = m`, by induction on the
     `PairedExceptOne` derivation; the `pair` case is exactly the cancellation lemma
     `xorFn_pair_cancel`.
