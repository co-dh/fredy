  LeetCode 387 — First Unique Character in a String — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: return the index of the first character in a string `s` (char codes, `List Int`) that
  occurs exactly once; `none` (LeetCode's `-1`) if no character is unique.

  Like `leet/L1.lean` (`leetcode.md` S34), this is a WITNESS-SEARCH problem over a plain
  `List Int` (no `SnocList` engine: one left-to-right pass), phrased via `List.getElem?` (`L238`'s
  trick, `leetcode.md` S23) so index bounds are CONSEQUENCES of `= some _` facts, not separate
  hypotheses.

  1. **Data / program** — reuses `leet.L242`'s `countL : List Int → Int → Nat` ("unique" means
     `countL s c = 1` against the WHOLE string).  `scanFrom full l i` scans a suffix `l`, an
     `i`-offset tail of the FIXED full string, re-counting every candidate against `full` (never
     against `l`); `firstUniqFn s := scanFrom s s 0`.

  2. **Specification** — `IsFirstUniq s i` : the character at `i` is unique in `s`, and every
     earlier index holds a character occurring `≥ 2` times ("first" = leftmost).

  3. **Correctness** — `firstUniq_correct` bundles soundness (`some i` ⟹ `IsFirstUniq s i`) and
     none-completeness (`none` ⟹ no index of `s` holds a unique character at all).  Both come from
     ONE invariant lemma `scanFrom_correct`, proved by a single induction on the suffix `l`,
     carrying forward the precondition "nothing before index `i` is unique" — the S18/S19-style
     paired invariant, here unifying the `some`/`none` branches of a `match` instead of two
     separate theorems.

  Mathlib-free; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} (fully constructive, no `Classical.choice`).

/-! ## Data: a string is a plain `List Int` (char codes); answer is `Option Nat` -/

/-- The object of strings in `Rel(Set)`. -/
abbrev Str : RelSet.{0} := ⟨List Int⟩
/-- The answer object: an optional index. -/
abbrev Ans : RelSet.{0} := ⟨Option Nat⟩

/-! ## The program: scan `s`, carrying the FULL string (fixed, for `countL`) and the current
    index alongside the shrinking suffix being consumed. -/

/-- `scanFrom full l i` — the first index `≥ i` of a character unique in `full`, scanning the
    suffix `l` (an `i`-offset tail of `full`); `countL` is always taken against `full`, never
    against `l`. -/

  | c :: rest, i => if countL full c = 1 then some i else scanFrom full rest (i + 1)

/-- `solve` is a `Map` (it is the graph of a function). -/
theorem solve_map : Map solve := graph_map firstUniqFn

/-! ## Specification -/

/-- **The specification**: `i` is the first unique-character index of `s` — the character at `i`
    occurs exactly once in the WHOLE string, and every earlier index holds a character occurring
    at least twice. -/
def IsFirstUniq (s : List Int) (i : Nat) : Prop :=
  (∃ c, s[i]? = some c ∧ countL s c = 1) ∧
  ∀ j, j < i → ∀ c, s[j]? = some c → countL s c ≥ 2

/-! ## Correctness -/

/-- **The crux invariant.**  Given `l` is the `i`-offset suffix of `full` (`full = pre ++ l`,
    `i = pre.length`) and no index before `i` holds a unique character, `scanFrom full l i` finds
    the first unique index at or after `i` (`some` case), or — once `l` is exhausted — confirms NO
    index of `full` at all holds a unique character (`none` case).  Proved by ONE induction on
    `l`, propagating the "nothing seen so far is unique" precondition forward at each step. -/
