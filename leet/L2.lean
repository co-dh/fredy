  LeetCode 2 — Add Two Numbers — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: two non-negative integers are given as digit lists in LITTLE-ENDIAN order (least
  significant digit first, each digit `0..9`), as `List Int`.  Return their sum, also as a
  little-endian digit list.

  Genuinely a TWO-INPUT recursion (like `L21`'s merge): each step consumes a digit off BOTH
  lists at once (`0` once a list runs dry), so neither input is a structural subterm of the
  other and a naive definition compiles to well-founded recursion.  TAMED with the FUEL trick
  (Skill S13/S21): `addFuel : Nat → Int → List Int → List Int → List Int` recurses on an
  explicit fuel parameter, structurally, staying kernel-reducible (`decide` works directly).
  `addFuel`'s carry parameter `c` starts at `0` and is *itself* a `10`-quotient of the previous
  digit sum — the standard schoolbook carry-ripple addition.

  1. **Program** — `addFuel fuel c xs ys`: if both lists are empty, emit the leftover carry (or
     nothing); otherwise pop a digit from each PRESENT list (`0` if a list is already exhausted),
     form `s := c + x + y`, emit `s % 10`, and recurse on one less fuel with carry `s / 10`.
     `addFn xs ys := addFuel (xs.length + ys.length + 1) 0 xs ys` — the `+1` covers the final
     carry-out digit, so the bound is always sufficient (never merely tight, unlike `L21`'s exact
     accounting: here a genuine EXTRA digit can appear, e.g. `99 + 1 = 100`).

  2. **Specification — honest VALUE PRESERVATION.** `value : List Int → Int`, `value [] = 0`,
     `value (d :: ds) = d + 10 * value ds` reads a little-endian digit list back into the integer
     it denotes (for ANY `Int` digits — the `0..9` range is not needed for this identity, so it is
     stated in full generality, not merely for the actual `0..9` inputs). The crux lemma is
     CARRY-GENERAL: `addFuel_value : xs.length + ys.length ≤ fuel → value (addFuel fuel c xs ys) =
     c + value xs + value ys`, by induction on `fuel`. `add_correct` specializes it at
     `c := 0`, `fuel := xs.length + ys.length + 1`: `value (addFn xs ys) = value xs + value ys`.

  3. **The arithmetic crux**: unpacking one carry-ripple step needs `10 * (s / 10) + s % 10 = s`
     (`Int.mul_ediv_add_emod s 10`, the non-deprecated form of `Int.ediv_add_emod`) — kept as an
     explicit hypothesis rather than asking `omega` to discover the `/`,`%` relationship itself,
     so the arithmetic stays a transparent linear combination once that one nonlinear fact is
     supplied.

  Mathlib-free; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} — fully constructive, no `Classical.choice`.

/-! ## Value semantics: read a little-endian digit list back into the integer it denotes -/

/-- `value [] = 0`, `value (d :: ds) = d + 10 * value ds` — holds for ANY `Int` digit list, not
    just `0..9` digits; only this general form is needed for `add_correct`. -/

  | d :: ds => d + 10 * value ds

/-! ## Program: carry-ripple addition, tamed by an explicit fuel parameter (Skill S13/S21) -/

/-- `addFuel fuel c xs ys` — schoolbook addition with carry `c`.  Both lists empty: emit the
    leftover carry (`[]` if it is `0`).  Otherwise: pop a digit from each PRESENT list (`0` if a
    list is already exhausted), emit `s % 10` for `s := c + x + y`, recurse with carry `s / 10` on
    one less fuel.  Structural on `fuel`, hence kernel-reducible. -/
def addFuel : Nat → Int → List Int → List Int → List Int

  | _ + 1, c, [], [] => if c = 0 then [] else [c]
  | fuel + 1, c, x :: xs, [] => (c + x) % 10 :: addFuel fuel ((c + x) / 10) xs []

  | fuel + 1, c, x :: xs, y :: ys => (c + x + y) % 10 :: addFuel fuel ((c + x + y) / 10) xs ys

/-- **The program**: add two little-endian digit lists, run with `xs.length + ys.length + 1`
    fuel — sufficient (not merely exact, unlike `L21`'s merge): the `+1` covers a genuine
    carry-out digit past the longer input, e.g. `addFn [9,9] [1] = [0,0,1]` (`99 + 1 = 100`). -/
def addFn (xs ys : List Int) : List Int := addFuel (xs.length + ys.length + 1) 0 xs ys

/-! ## Correctness: value preservation, carry-general first -/

/-- **The crux lemma, CARRY-GENERAL**: for any starting carry `c` and any fuel covering both
    lists' lengths, the value of the fold's output is `c` plus the two input values.  Proved by
    induction on `fuel`; each cons/cons (or cons/nil, nil/cons) step needs exactly ONE nonlinear
    fact, `10 * (s / 10) + s % 10 = s` (`Int.mul_ediv_add_emod`), supplied explicitly — the
    remainder of each step is then a pure linear rearrangement. -/

/-! ## The morphism-equation headline (value level)

  The output is a canonical little-endian digit list, but the VALUE equation alone does not pin it
  (`[7,0,8]` and `[7,0,8,0]` both denote `708`).  Full pinning needs a `Canon` uniqueness lemma
  plus a two-input carry `addFuel_canon` (the analogue of `leet/L66.lean`'s `plusOneRev_canon`,
  longer here because of the two-list carry ripple) — deferred.  What IS a clean morphism equation:
  decoding `solve`'s output gives exactly the sum of the two input values. -/

    two input numbers.  (Program-independent; does NOT pin the digit list — canonicity would.) -/
def spec : dInput ⟶ dAns := fun p out => value out = value p.1 + value p.2

/-- **The value-level headline**: `solve ≫ value = (the sum of the two input values)` as morphisms
    into `⟨Int⟩` — decode the program's output and you get the sum, exactly (not merely pointwise).
    (The weaker-than-`solve = spec` shape is the honest one: `value` under-determines the digits.) -/
