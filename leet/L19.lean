  LeetCode 19 — Remove Nth Node From End of List — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: remove the `n`-th node from the END of a list (1-indexed from the end) and return the
  resulting list, under the precondition `1 ≤ n ≤ xs.length`.  This repo models the list as a
  plain `List Int` (no linked-list pointer surgery, matching `L206`/`L21`): the node to remove
  sits at the 0-INDEXED position `k := xs.length - n` FROM THE FRONT, so "removal" is
  `xs.take k ++ xs.drop (k+1)` — keep everything strictly before `k`, drop the element at `k`,
  keep everything from `k+1` on.

  1. **Program** — `removeNthFn xs n := xs.take (xs.length - n) ++ xs.drop (xs.length - n + 1)`.

  2. **Specification — honest, three-part, getElem?-phrased (Skill S23).**  For `1 ≤ n ≤
     xs.length` (so `k := xs.length - n` is a genuine in-range index):
     - LENGTH: `(removeNthFn xs n).length = xs.length - 1`.
     - BEFORE `k`, unchanged: `∀ i, i < k → (removeNthFn xs n)[i]? = xs[i]?`.
     - AT/AFTER `k`, shifted left by one: `∀ i, k ≤ i → (removeNthFn xs n)[i]? = xs[i+1]?`.
     Together these pin down the ENTIRE output list, not just its length — every surviving
     position is accounted for on both sides of the cut.  A fourth, bonus fact nails down WHICH
     element was removed: `removeNth_splice` shows splicing `xs[k]` back in between the front/back
     halves of `removeNthFn xs n` recovers `xs` exactly — i.e. the element removed genuinely IS
     the `n`-th from the end, not merely "some element consistent with the length dropping by 1".

  3. **Correctness = `removeNth_correct`**, the conjunction of the three getElem?-phrased bullets.

/-- **The program**: remove the element at 0-indexed position `xs.length - n` (the `n`-th from
    the end) by keeping everything before it and everything after it. -/
def removeNthFn (xs : List Int) (n : Nat) : List Int :=
  xs.take (xs.length - n) ++ xs.drop (xs.length - n + 1)

/-! ## Correctness -/

/-- **Length**: removing one node shortens the list by exactly one. -/

    if_pos (by omega)]

/-- **Positions at/after `k` shift left by one** (the element at `k` was deleted, so what used to
    sit at `i+1` now sits at `i`). -/

/-- **Headline correctness**: `removeNthFn xs n` is `xs` with exactly the `(xs.length-n)`-th
    element deleted — length drops by one, every earlier position is untouched, every later
    position shifts left by one. -/
theorem removeNth_correct (xs : List Int) (n : Nat) (hn1 : 1 ≤ n) (hn2 : n ≤ xs.length) :
    (removeNthFn xs n).length = xs.length - 1 ∧
    (∀ i, i < xs.length - n → (removeNthFn xs n)[i]? = xs[i]?) ∧
    (∀ i, xs.length - n ≤ i → (removeNthFn xs n)[i]? = xs[i + 1]?) :=
  ⟨removeNth_length xs n hn1 hn2, removeNth_getElem?_lt xs n hn1 hn2,
   removeNth_getElem?_ge xs n hn1 hn2⟩

/-- **Bonus: the removed element is exactly the `n`-th from the end.**  Splicing `xs[k]` back in
    between the front (`take k`) and back (`drop (k+1)`) halves of `removeNthFn xs n` recovers
    `xs` exactly, at position `k := xs.length - n` — so the element genuinely deleted is `xs[k]`,
    not merely "some element consistent with the shorter length". The proof `h` of the dependent
    index is bound once and reused on both sides, so `rw` needs no proof-irrelevance juggling. -/
theorem removeNth_splice (xs : List Int) (n : Nat) (hn1 : 1 ≤ n) (hn2 : n ≤ xs.length) :
    ∀ h : xs.length - n < xs.length,
      xs.take (xs.length - n) ++ xs[xs.length - n]'h :: xs.drop (xs.length - n + 1) = xs :=
  fun h => by rw [← List.drop_eq_getElem_cons h, List.take_append_drop]

/-- `solve` is a `Map` (it is the graph of a function). -/
theorem solve_map : Map solve := graph_map _

/-- **The specification** as a morphism `dInput ⟶ dAns`: given a valid `1 ≤ n ≤ xs.length`, the
    output satisfies the three-part `removeNth_correct` shape. -/

    (∀ i, p.1.length - p.2 ≤ i → out[i]? = p.1[i + 1]?)

    returns satisfies `spec`. -/

/-- **Uniqueness of a spec output**: the two index clauses (before/at-or-after the removed position)
    partition ALL indices and pin `out[i]?` for each, so any two outputs meeting the characterization
    agree everywhere, hence are equal by list extensionality.  No precondition is needed here — the
    characterization alone is already functional. -/

def pre : dInput ⟶ dInput := fun p q => p = q ∧ 1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 ≤ p.1.length

/-- **Preconditioned headline**: restricted to valid removal positions (`pre`), the program equals
    the specification — `pre ≫ solve = pre ≫ spec`.  Existence is `removeNth_correct`; uniqueness is
    `spec_out_unique` (the index characterization is functional). -/
