  LeetCode 435 — Non-overlapping Intervals — DERIVED as TWO cons-list catamorphisms.

  `leet/L435.lean` writes `solveFn ivs = ivs.length - (keptSorted (isortH ivs)).length` as two
  hand-written recursions over a RAW Lean `List (Int × Int)`:

    * `isortH`     — insertion sort by `.2` (end time): `isortH [] = []`,
                     `isortH (iv :: rest) = linsertH iv (isortH rest)`;
    * `keptList`   — the greedy left-to-right scan over the SORTED list, threading a running
                     threshold `lastEnd` FORWARD through the recursive call: `keptList lastEnd []
                     = []`, `keptList lastEnd (iv :: rest) = if lastEnd ≤ iv.1 then iv ::
                     keptList iv.2 rest else keptList lastEnd rest`.

  This file RESHAPES both onto the canonical cons-list initial algebra `ConsList Unit (Int×Int)`
  (`Freyd.Alg.RelSet.CL.ofList`) and shows each EMERGES from the general-carrier law
  `CL.consFold_unique` (`AOP/A6_GenFold.lean`) — the recursions were never hand-written as folds.

  1. **`isortH` — a plain `List (Int×Int)` carrier.**  Already exactly the cons-fold shape (no
     lookahead needed, unlike `L26`'s dedup): base `gSort _ = []`, step `stSort iv acc = linsertH
     iv acc`.  `foldSort` obeys `foldSort (wrap _) = gSort ()`, `foldSort (cons iv xs) = stSort iv
     (foldSort xs)` by construction (both `rfl`), so `sort_emerges` reads it straight off
     `consFold_unique`.  Insertion sort is inherently `O(n²)` (as `L56`/`L252`'s `isort`) — that
     cost is unchanged here, not re-derived away.

  2. **`keptList` — the CPS/threshold-scan trick (as `L252_derived`'s `noAdjFromC`), carrier `C :=
     Int → List (Int×Int)`.**  `keptList`'s own recursion THREADS the threshold `lastEnd` forward,
     which a plain cons-fold `st : E → C → C` cannot see directly (the next call's threshold isn't
     the folded tail's own value, it depends on the NEWLY kept head).  Curry the threshold to the
     other side: fold the list FIRST into a RESIDUAL `foldKept l : Int → List (Int×Int)` that still
     AWAITS the threshold `lastEnd` — for every threshold `t`, `foldKept l t` IS `keptList t l`
     (hence "carrier `(lastEnd, keptList)`": the residual's argument/result pair is exactly that).
     Base `gKept _ = fun _ => []` (an empty suffix keeps nothing at any threshold); step `stKept iv
     frest := fun lastEnd => if lastEnd ≤ iv.1 then iv :: frest iv.2 else frest lastEnd` — read
     straight off `keptList`'s own cons clause, curried in the awaited threshold, with the
     recursive call's ADVANCED threshold `iv.2` fed to the folded tail's own residual `frest`. The
     kept sub-list is built by CONSING the newly-kept head onto `frest iv.2` (never `acc ++ [x]`),
     so the scan stays a single `O(n)` pass once `frest` is applied.  `foldKept` obeys `foldKept
     (wrap d) = gKept d`, `foldKept (cons iv xs) = stKept iv (foldKept xs)` by construction (both
     `rfl`), so `kept_emerges` reads straight off `consFold_unique`.

  3. **Composing.**  `derivedSolve ivs := ivs.length - (foldKeptSorted (foldSort (ofList
     ivs))).length` runs the emergent sort, then seeds the emergent scan from the sorted list's own
     head exactly as `L435.keptSorted` does; `derivedSolve_eq` shows it agrees with `LC435.solveFn`
     pointwise, by the SAME bridging recipe as `L252_derived`'s `noAdjFromC_ofList` (induction on the
     raw list, every step unfolds definitionally).

  4. **Correctness is REUSED, not re-proved**, from `LC435.solve_correct` (achievability +
     domination, headline shape 2, extremum/min-removals).  Honest note on the headline SHAPE: the
     unconditional morphism-equation form `graph solveFn = A spec ≫ maxRel D`
     (`A7_4_Horner.eq_A_comp_maxRel`) does NOT apply here, for the SAME reason as `L11_derived`:
     `LC435.solve_correct` is CONDITIONAL on `Valid ivs` (every interval's `.1 < .2`, LeetCode 435's
     own strict constraint — genuinely load-bearing, per `L435.lean`'s own `Valid` docstring, not a
     proof artifact) — `eq_A_comp_maxRel` demands `hsound`/`hbest` UNCONDITIONALLY over the whole
     domain, which is false for degenerate/invalid interval lists.  We therefore state the honest
     bundle: both emergences (unconditional) ∧ `derivedSolve = solveFn` ∧ the reused CONDITIONAL
     achievability+domination pair, exactly `LC435.solve_correct`'s own shape.

  **Complexity**: `derivedSolve` is `O(n²)` overall, same as `LC435.solveFn` — dominated by
  `isortH`'s inherent `O(n²)` insertion sort (unchanged, not re-derived); the emergent greedy scan
  itself is a single `O(n)` pass (one cons + one comparison per element, once the residual is
  applied to a threshold).

  Mathlib-free (Lean core + `AOP.A6_GenFold`, `AOP.A6_ConsList`, `leet.L435` only).  We route
  through `CL.consFold_unique` only, never `cataR_eq_relCata` (pulls `Classical.choice`).  No
  `Classical.choice`; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}.

/-! ## Part 2: `keptList`, reshaped as a CURRIED residual awaiting the threshold `lastEnd`

    Carrier `C := Int → List (Int×Int)` — the RESIDUAL scan that, having folded the list, still

    gKept stKept` on the FUNCTION carrier `Int → List (Int×Int)`, PRODUCED by `CL.consFold_unique`

    `solve_correct` is CONDITIONAL on `Valid ivs`, so the unconditional morphism-equation headline

    emergences with the reused conditional achievability+domination pair instead. -/

    (2) `kept_emerges` — the greedy threshold scan IS the catamorphism of `consScalarAlg gKept
        stKept` on the residual carrier `Int → List (Int×Int)`, produced by `CL.consFold_unique`;
    (3) `derivedSolve ivs = solveFn ivs` — the composed derived program agrees with the hand-written
        one;
    (4) achievability + domination for `derivedSolve`, REUSED from `LC435.solve_correct` (NOT
        re-proved) — min removals is exactly `ivs.length - derivedSolve ivs`'s complementary
        maximum kept sub-selection. -/
