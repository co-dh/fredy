  LeetCode 121 — Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM,
  derived through the generic running-best driver `rel.AutoDerive`.

  Problem: given prices `x₀,…,x_{n-1}` (one per day), pick a buy day `i` and a later sell day `j > i`
  maximising the profit `x_j − x_i`; if no trade is profitable, the answer is `0`.

  The point of this file is to *program in the allegory* `Rel(Set)` (Freyd's category of sets and
  relations, `AOP.A6_1_RelSet`), reusing the Bird & de Moor toolkit:

  1. **Data** — a non-empty list of prices is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of the functor
     `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ` (the reusable engine `AOP.A6_SnocList`).  `wrap x` is a single price,
     `snoc xs p` appends a price — so a left-to-right scan is a CATAMORPHISM over this datatype.

  2. **Program** — the O(n) sweep is the fold with state `(minSoFar, bestProfit)` and algebra
     `[ x ↦ (x,0),  ((m,b),p) ↦ (min m p, max b (p−m)) ]`.  We package it as a genuine morphism
     `solve : Prices ⟶ ℤ` in `Rel(Set)` (a `Map`, i.e. the graph of a function) and prove it *is*
     the catamorphism of that algebra followed by the second projection (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — `spec : Prices ⟶ ℤ` is the relation of *achievable* profits: `0`, or `s−b`
     for a buy price `b` occurring strictly before a sell price `s`.  LeetCode asks for its
     `≤`-maximum, i.e. `max (≤) · Λ spec` in `Rel(Set)`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum (`solve_correct`, `solve_eq_maxRel`).
     Every relational side condition of the greedy derivation (order transitivity, `MonotonicAlg`,
     the greedy-step refinement, fold = catamorphism, generator totality — formerly ~100 hand-written
     lines here) is discharged by the `RunningBest` driver from the bundle `trade` below; this file
     supplies only the CREATIVE content: the bundle's fields (state pair + generator candidates +
     dominance order + eight one-line arithmetic facts) and the generator-vs-spec characterisation
     (`gen_sound`/`spec_gen`), the genuinely problem-specific inductions.

  Mathlib-free.  Axioms of the headline: {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} — the
  `Classical.choice` is the honest cost of the relational-catamorphism universal property,
  inherited via `cataR_eq_relCata`.

  profit `b` is kept or reset to `p - m`.  `alg` is one deterministic choice inside it — all of
  which the driver now derives from the bundle (`gen_eq`); only the characterisation
