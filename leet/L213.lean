  LeetCode 213 — House Robber II — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: like LeetCode 198 (`leet/L198.lean`), but the houses stand in a CIRCLE — the first and
  last house are now adjacent, so a selection may never take BOTH of them.  Robbing nothing is
  always allowed.

  **Circular DP = max over two linear passes that each break the ring.**  Any non-adjacent
  selection that avoids taking both ends fails to contain the last house, or fails to contain the
  first house (or both) — so it lies entirely within `dropLast` (drop the last house) or entirely
  within `tail` (drop the first house), each an ordinary LINEAR house row with no wraparound.
  Conversely every linear selection of either sub-row is already such a selection of the full
  circle (it never touches the dropped end).  So the answer is `max(robLine dropLast, robLine
  tail)`, reusing L198's linear fold on each sub-row.  A single house is the one place this breaks
  down (both sub-rows come out empty) and gets its own `rob-it-or-not` case.

  1. **Data** — same `SnocList ℤ ℤ` as L198; `toList` unpacks it to a plain `List Int` so
     `dropLast`/`tail` make sense.

  2. **Program** — `robLine : List Int → Int`, L198's `foldFn`/`solveFn` fold ported to `List Int`
     (base case `[]` ↦ `0`, the sum of the empty selection) so it applies uniformly to any
     sub-row, including the empty one.  `solveFn xs`: if `toList xs` is a singleton `[x]`, answer
     `imax x 0`; otherwise `imax (robLine dropLast) (robLine tail)`.

  3. **Specification** — `circSpec xs v`: `v` is achievable as a linear (non-wraparound) robbery
     of `dropLast`, OR of `tail` — i.e. `v` is a non-adjacent-selection sum that does not take both
     the first and the last house (the argument above).  The singleton case gets its own
     `v = x ∨ v = 0` clause, since `dropLast`/`tail` both collapse to `[]` there.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve = max (≤) · Λ circSpec`, built from the LINEAR fold's own
     refinement+domination (`robLine_correct`, a direct port of L198's `foldFn_dominates`/
     `foldFn_is_rob` to `List Int`) glued at the `imax` by one generic two-list lemma
     (`imax_disj_correct`) — no separate "circular gluing" proof needed once `circSpec` is stated
     as the disjunction of the two linear specs.
