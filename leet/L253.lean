  LeetCode 253 — Meeting Rooms II — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given meeting intervals `(lo, hi) : Int × Int` (`iv.1` start, `iv.2` end; a meeting
  occupies the HALF-OPEN instant range `[iv.1, iv.2)`), return the MINIMUM number of conference
  rooms required — equivalently, the MAXIMUM number of meetings that overlap at any single instant.

  Same recipe family as `leet/L56.lean` (Merge Intervals) and `leet/L252.lean` (Meeting Rooms),
  but the honest spec is a genuine EXTREMUM (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S0), not a decision or a
  structural output.

  Route (no event sweep, no sort needed): the maximum overlap over ALL instants is attained AT SOME
  MEETING'S START — so it suffices to compute, for each meeting's own start `s`, how many meetings
  cover `s`, and take the max over the (finite) list of starts.

  1. **Data** — `List (Int × Int)`, `.1` = start, `.2` = end (no `SnocList`/sort machinery needed).

  2. **Program** — `countCover ivs t` counts meetings occupying instant `t` (a `List.filter` on the
     half-open membership test, kept `decide`-able); `roomsFn ivs` is the max, over each meeting's
     OWN start, of `countCover ivs` at that start — a `Nat.max`-fold (`nmax`, ported from `L56`'s
     `imax` to control the rewrite set) over `ivs.map (countCover ivs ·.1)`.

  3. **Specification** — `roomsFn ivs` equals `max over ALL instants t of countCover ivs t`,
     phrased honestly as an achievability + domination pair (S0's extremum shape), with NO ordering
     hypothesis on `ivs` needed (the argument is purely combinatorial):
       - **domination** (`rooms_dominates`) — `∀ t, countCover ivs t ≤ roomsFn ivs`. The crux:
         among the (possibly empty) set `S` of meetings covering `t`, take a member `m` with the
         LATEST start (`exists_max_start`, a plain constructive "nonempty list has a max-by-key
         element", no `Classical.choice`). Since `m.1 ≤ t` (m covers `t`) and every other `iv ∈ S`
         has `t < iv.2`, we get `m.1 < iv.2` for every `iv ∈ S`; combined with `iv.1 ≤ m.1`
         (maximality of `m.1`), EVERY meeting covering `t` also covers `m.1` — so
         `countCover ivs t ≤ countCover ivs m.1 ≤ roomsFn ivs` (the last step since `m ∈ ivs` and
         `m.1` is literally one of the starts `roomsFn` maxes over).
       - **achievability** (`rooms_achievable`) — `∃ t, countCover ivs t = roomsFn ivs`. Immediate:
         `roomsFn ivs` is itself a `nmax`-fold of actual `countCover ivs (·.1)` values (or `0` when
         `ivs = []`, witnessed by any `t`, e.g. `0`), so it equals one of them
         (`foldMax_mem_or_nil`, a generic "the max of a Nat list, folded from `0`, is `0` or a list
         member" fact).

  4. **Correctness (headline)** — `rooms_correct : (∃ t, countCover ivs t = roomsFn ivs) ∧
     (∀ t, countCover ivs t ≤ roomsFn ivs)` — `roomsFn` IS `max over all instants of countCover`,
     not a restatement of the program.

  Mathlib-free (Lean core `List.filter`/`mem_filter`/`mem_map` + `AOP.A6_1_RelSet` only). No
  `Classical.choice`: the domination argument builds the max-by-`.1` witness constructively by list
  induction (never appeals to well-ordering/choice on an infinite index set — `t` ranges over `Int`,
  but the crux argument only ever needs the FINITE set of meetings, not the instants). The `Bool`
  filter predicate is read back to `Prop` via core's `of_decide_eq_true`/`decide_eq_true_eq`, never
  via `List.filter_eq_nil_iff` (the `Classical.choice`-pulling trap flagged in `leetcode.md` S28).
