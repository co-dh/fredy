  LeetCode 9 — Palindrome Number — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given an integer `n`, decide whether it is a palindrome, i.e. whether its base-10
  digit sequence reads the same forwards and backwards.  Negative numbers are NEVER palindromes
  (the leading `-` breaks the symmetry).

  Same DECISION-problem recipe as `leet/L217.lean`/`leet/L125.lean` (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S5):
  correctness is a plain `iff`, not a refinement+domination extremum.  Unlike those two, the
  input here is a bare `Int`, not a `SnocList` — the digit SEQUENCE is extracted internally by a
  fuel-guarded value-recursion (`Fredy/leetcode.md` S13), since peeling `n / 10` decreases a
  second, independently-shrinking argument and so does not compile to plain structural
  recursion.

  1. **Data** — the input object is `Int` directly (no datatype engine needed); the answer
     object is `Bool`.

  2. **Digit extraction (fuel).** `toDigitsFuel fuel n` peels the last digit (`n % 10`) while
     `n ≥ 10`, recursing on the FUEL (an ordinary `Nat.rec`, kernel-reducible, so `decide` can
     run it) rather than on `n` itself.  `toDigits n := toDigitsFuel (n+1) n` — fuel `n+1` is
     always enough, since a natural number's digit count never exceeds `n+1`.  The digits come
     out LEAST-significant-first; this does not affect the palindrome check, since for any list
     `ds`, `ds = ds.reverse ↔ ds.reverse = ds.reverse.reverse` — reading the digits forwards or
     backwards decides the same self-reversal fact.

  3. **Program.** `isPalinNumFn n := if n < 0 then false else decide (toDigits n.toNat =
     (toDigits n.toNat).reverse)`.  The sign is guarded once, at the `Int` boundary; the digit
     work itself stays on `Nat`.

  4. **Specification and correctness.** `palin_correct` is the honest unfolding: `n` is a
     palindrome iff it is non-negative AND its digit sequence is its own reverse — the
     self-reversal predicate on `toDigits n.toNat` IS the definition of "palindrome number", the
     same way `leet/L125.lean`'s `IsPalin` is `toList xs = (toList xs).reverse` on an already-
     given sequence.
