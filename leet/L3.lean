  LeetCode 3 — Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given a non-empty string `x₀,…,x_{n-1}` of characters, find the length of the longest
  contiguous substring all of whose characters are pairwise distinct.

  Same recipe as `leet/L53.lean` / `leet/L300.lean` (see `Fredy/leetcode.md`, skill S0/S1):

  1. **Data** — the string is the initial algebra `SnocList ℤ ℤ` of `F X = ℤ + X × ℤ`
     (`AOP.A6_SnocList`, characters encoded as `Int`); `wrap x` is a single-character string,
     `snoc xs c` appends a character.

  2. **Program** — a left-to-right SLIDING-WINDOW scan.  Rather than tracking the window as a pair
     of positions `(windowStart, index)` plus a position map, the fold carries the window's
     CONTENT: `seen : List Int`, the characters currently in the window, most-recent-first.  On a
     new character `c`, `survive seen c` drops `c` and everything OLDER than it from `seen` (i.e.
     slides `windowStart` past the previous occurrence of `c`, or leaves `seen` untouched if `c`
     is not currently in the window), then `c` is prepended.  This is the same last-seen-index
     sliding window, phrased on the window's content instead of on positions.  `best` is the
     running max of the window length.  We package it as a `Map` `solve : Str ⟶ ℕ` in `Rel(Set)`
     and prove it *is* the catamorphism of that algebra followed by the second projection
     (`solve_eq_cata`).

  3. **Specification** — a two-layer relation in the L53/L300 style: `DistinctSuffix xs k` — `k` is
     (at most) the length of `xs` and the last `k` characters of `xs` are pairwise distinct (via
     the position-free extraction `suffixList xs k`, capped structurally, paired with the explicit
     bound `k ≤ len xs`).  `DistinctAt xs k` — `k` is the length of SOME contiguous substring of
     `xs`: achievable within a strict prefix, or (in the `snoc` case) a distinct suffix of the
     whole `snoc xs c`.  LeetCode 3 asks for its `≤`-maximum, `max (≤) · Λ DistinctAt`.

  4. **Correctness** — `solve` computes exactly that maximum: it returns an achievable substring
     length (`solve_achievable`, giving `solve ⊑ spec`) and dominates every achievable substring
     length (`domination_all`).  Together (`solve_correct`) this is `solve = max (≤) · Λ DistinctAt`.
     The bridge between the fold's `seen` list and the structural spec is carried by:
     `foldFn_seen_eq_suffixList` (`seen` IS the length-`seen.length` suffix of `xs`),
     `foldFn_seen_distinct` (`seen` has no repeats), and `survive_length_ge_of_not_mem_take` (the
     crux optimality fact: sliding the window only as far as the previous occurrence of `c`, no
     further, never over-shrinks — any distinct window not containing `c` survives intact).
