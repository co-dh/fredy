  LeetCode 11 — Container With Most Water — DERIVED as a relational HYLOMORPHISM (O(n)).

  `leet/L11.lean` writes the two-pointer sweep `twoPtrFuel` over a `List Int`, tamed with an explicit
  `fuel` parameter (the two indices `lo`/`hi` move independently, so the recursion is not structural on
  either one).  Two prices are paid there: the `fuel` bookkeeping, and — because a `List` is indexed by
  `h[i]!` in O(i) — an O(n²) sweep.

  The right scheme for a two-pointer / measured recursion is the DUAL of the fold: a RECURSIVE COALGEBRA
  `c : S → L + E×S` whose unfolding is well-founded, re-folded with an algebra `[g, st]`.
  `Hylo.hyloFold_unique` (`AOP/A6_GenHylo.lean`) is the uniqueness law: any function `h` obeying
  `h s = match c s with | inl l => g l | inr (e,s') => st e (h s')` IS the hylomorphism `hyloR c μ hdec g st`.

  Instantiation for L11 (heights fixed as an `Array Int` for O(1) access — the O(n) upgrade):
    * state       `S := Nat × Nat` — the window `(lo, hi)`;
    * measure     `μ (lo,hi) := hi - lo`, dropping by one on each `.inr` step (`hdec`);
    * coalgebra   `c (lo,hi)` — leaf `.inl ()` when the window has collapsed (`lo ≥ hi`), else EMIT the
      current window's area `min h[lo] h[hi] · (hi−lo)` as an `.inr` node and move the SHORTER wall inward
      (branch order matching `LC11.twoPtrFuel` exactly);
    * algebra     base `g := fun _ => 0` (an empty window holds no water), step `st := LC11.imax` (fold the
      emitted areas with `max`) — headline shape 2 (extremum, max).

  `sweep_emerges` runs `hyloFold_unique` on the Array-based sweep `sweep`: it certifies that the O(n)
  program IS the relational hylomorphism of `c` — the program was never re-written, only shown to satisfy
  the hylomorphism recurrence (discharged IN PLACE by a case split).  Correctness — achievability +
  domination over EVERY pair — is REUSED from `L11.lean` (`LC11.maxArea_achievable`/`maxArea_dominates`)
  through the bridge `arrSolve h = LC11.maxAreaFn h.toList` (the Array sweep equals the List sweep); it is
  not re-proved.

  Honest headline note: `LC11.maxArea_correct` is CONDITIONAL on `Nonneg h.toList` (heights `≥ 0`) and
  `2 ≤ h.toList.length` (a valid pair exists).  For `n < 2` the achievability relation `IsPairArea` is
  empty while `arrSolve` returns `0`, so the unconditional morphism-equation headline `graph solveFn =
  A spec ≫ maxRel D` (`A7_4_Horner.eq_A_comp_maxRel`) does NOT hold here.  We therefore state the honest
  bundle: emergence (unconditional) ∧ the reused conditional correctness.

  Mathlib-free; headline axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} (fully constructive, no `Classical.choice`).

/-! ## The two-pointer sweep as a measured recursive coalgebra (heights fixed as an `Array Int`) -/

/-- The window's water area over an `Array Int` (O(1) indexing).  Same formula as `LC11.Area`, but on an
    array — this is the O(n) upgrade of the O(n²) `List` version. -/
def areaA (h : Array Int) (lo hi : Nat) : Int := LC11.imin h[lo]! h[hi]! * ((hi : Int) - (lo : Int))

/-- The sweep coalgebra: emit a leaf (`.inl ()`) once the window has collapsed (`lo ≥ hi`), otherwise EMIT
    the current window's area as a node (`.inr`) and move the SHORTER wall inward.  Branch order matches
    `LC11.twoPtrFuel`'s recurrence EXACTLY (test `lo < hi`, then compare `h[lo]` vs `h[hi]`). -/
def c (h : Array Int) : Nat × Nat → Sum Unit (Int × (Nat × Nat)) := fun p =>
  if p.1 < p.2 then
    if h[p.1]! ≤ h[p.2]! then Sum.inr (areaA h p.1 p.2, (p.1 + 1, p.2))
    else Sum.inr (areaA h p.1 p.2, (p.1, p.2 - 1))
  else Sum.inl ()

/-- The measure: window width.  The coalgebra's unfolding is well-founded because every `.inr` step
    moves one wall inward, dropping the width by one (`hdec`). -/
def μ : Nat × Nat → Nat := fun p => p.2 - p.1

/-- Every `.inr` step drops the width by one, so `μ` strictly decreases — the well-foundedness witness the
    hylomorphism law demands. -/

/-- **The derivation.**  The Array sweep `sweep h` IS the relational hylomorphism of the measured
    coalgebra `c h` with algebra `[fun _ => 0, LC11.imax]` — it was never re-written as a hylomorphism;
    `hyloFold_unique` certifies that it satisfies the hylomorphism recurrence.  The remaining goal is
    exactly "`sweep h` obeys `h s = match c h s with | inl _ => 0 | inr (e,s') => imax e (h s')`",
    discharged by the case split on the two `if`s of `sweep`/`c` (identical branch structure). -/

/-! ## Headline: emergence ∧ reused (conditional) correctness -/

/-- **Headline.**  The honest bundle:
    (1) the Array O(n) sweep `sweep h` IS the relational hylomorphism of the measured coalgebra `c h` with
        algebra `[fun _ => 0, LC11.imax]` (`sweep_emerges`) — the derivation; and
    (2) given the problem constraints (heights `≥ 0`, at least two lines), the program's answer
        `arrSolve h` is the `≤`-MAXIMUM of the achievability relation `LC11.IsPairArea h.toList`:
        achievable AND dominating every achievable area.  This is `LC11.maxArea_correct` carried across
        the bridge `arrSolve h = LC11.maxAreaFn h.toList` — REUSED, not re-proved. -/
theorem container_derived_correct (h : Array Int)

  · rw [arrSolve_eq]; intro a ha; exact LC11.maxArea_dominates hnn a ha

/-! ## Running the certified program

  `arrSolve`/`sweep` are WF-recursive (do not reduce under `decide`), so run the examples through the
  bridge `arrSolve_eq` to the kernel-reducible fuel-sweep on `h.toList`. -/

example : arrSolve #[1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7] = 49 := by rw [arrSolve_eq]; decide
example : arrSolve #[1, 1] = 1 := by rw [arrSolve_eq]; decide
