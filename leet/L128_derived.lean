  LeetCode 128 — Longest Consecutive Sequence — DERIVED, now in **O(n) expected** via a hash set.

  `leet/L128.lean` computes the answer by SORTING (`L242.isort`, O(n²) insertion sort) and then a
  left-to-right run-tracking scan.  This file replaces the sort by the standard hash-set algorithm,
  which is O(n) EXPECTED (the hash map's `find?`/`insert` are O(1) expected — see `A6_HashMap.lean`;
  the bound is informal, not proven in Lean):

    * **Phase 1** — fold `nums` into an `AHashSet` of all its elements (`build`, an `n`-step fold, each
      step an expected-O(1) `insert'`).  This fold is PRODUCED by the general cons-list fold-uniqueness
      law `CL.consFold_unique` (`setBuild_emerges`): the set-builder is the catamorphism of the scalar
      algebra with base `s0` and step `insert'` — the recursion is never hand-written.
    * **Phase 2** — for each element `x` that is a RUN START (`mem s (x-1) = false`), count the run
      `x, x+1, x+2, …` (`runFrom`, fuel-bounded by `nums.length`) and take the max (`LC128.nmax`).
      Each element is the interior of at most one run, so across all starts the run-counters touch each
      element O(1) times: O(n) expected total.  Phase 2 is a `foldl` max over run-lengths, NOT a
      catamorphism (it re-reads `nums` against the built set), so the whole program is `graph hashLongest`,
      not a single `cataR` — only Phase 1 emerges as a fold.

  **Correctness is proved directly against `L128`'s membership spec** (the two-phase structure does not
  map onto the sorted-scan invariant, so we do not reuse `LC128.scanAux_inv`).  The key facts, all
  axiom-clean:
    * `mem_build` — after Phase 1, `mem (build nums) x ↔ x ∈ nums` (the hash-set membership bridge).
    * `pigeon` — a length-`ℓ` block of consecutive integers all present in `nums` forces `ℓ ≤ nums.length`
      (finiteness, via a constructive one-element removal `rm`; this is what makes `fuel = nums.length`
      large enough for every run that can occur).
    * `runFrom_mem` / `runFrom_ge` — the run-counter's members are in the set, and a block of length `k`
      with `fuel ≥ k` is counted to length `≥ k`.
    * `runStart_P1` / `runStart_P2` + `run_start_exists` — a bounded backward walk locates, for any `s ∈ S`,
      the genuine run-start `t ≤ s` of the run through `s` (fuel exhaustion is ruled out by `pigeon`).
    * `hash_ach` / `hash_dom` — `hashLongest nums` achieves a value-run of its own length and dominates
      every value-run present in `nums` (the `Freyd/leetcode.md` S0 refinement + domination pair).
  `hashLongest = LC128.longestConsecFn` then follows by antisymmetry (`derivedSolve_eq_solve`), so the
  derived O(n) program is the SAME relation as `LC128.solve`, and the headline reuses the packaging.

/-! ## Correctness headline -/

/-- **Headline.**  The O(n)-expected hash-set program computes the Longest-Consecutive-Sequence
    optimum: `derivedSolve` relates each `nums` to a value `m` that is an achievable value-run length
    (some `s` with `s, s+1, …, s+m-1` all in `nums`) and dominates every value-run present in `nums`.
    Same statement (and drop-in name) as the sorting-based derivation; here proved directly from the
    hash-set membership spec. -/
theorem longestConsec_derived_correct (nums : List Int) :
    ∃ m, derivedSolve nums m ∧
      (∃ s : Int, ∀ i : Nat, i < m → s + (i : Int) ∈ nums) ∧
      (∀ (s : Int) (Lrun : Nat), (∀ i : Nat, i < Lrun → s + (i : Int) ∈ nums) → Lrun ≤ m) :=
  ⟨hashLongest nums, rfl, hash_ach nums, hash_dom nums⟩
