  LeetCode 13 — Roman to Integer — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: a roman numeral, given here directly as its list of symbol VALUES (I=1, V=5, X=10,
  L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000), left to right — return its integer value.  The standard rule: sum
  every symbol, EXCEPT a symbol strictly LESS than the symbol immediately following it, which is
  SUBTRACTED instead of added (e.g. `IV = [1,5] ↦ 5 - 1 = 4`).

  1. **Program** — `romanFn` is the textbook two-element-lookahead fold: at each symbol `x`,
     compare it to its immediate successor `y` (if any) and add `x` or `-x` accordingly, then
     recurse on the rest.  This recurrence IS the standard definition of a roman numeral's value —
     accepted as *the* definition, the way `L70`'s `climb`/`L91`'s `decode` are.

  2. **Specification** — a genuine RE-CHARACTERIZATION, not a restatement of the recurrence:
     `romanFn xs = xs.sum - 2 * subtractedPart xs`, where `subtractedPart` sums exactly the
     symbols that get subtracted.  Reading: "add every symbol, then take away TWICE each
     subtractive symbol" (once to cancel the `+x` it got from the naive sum, once more to make it
     `-x`).  Proved by the same two-element lookahead recursion as `romanFn` itself.

  3. **`Rel(Set)` packaging** — `solve := graph romanFn`, a `Map` (the graph of a function).

  Mathlib-free; fully constructive — axioms `⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`.

/-- **Honest closed-form spec**: the roman value is the plain sum of all symbols, minus TWICE the
    subtracted part — real content beyond the recurrence (a re-characterization, not a
    restatement).  Proved by the same two-element lookahead induction as `romanFn`. -/
