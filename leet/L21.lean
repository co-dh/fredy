  LeetCode 21 — Merge Two Sorted Lists — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given two sorted (non-decreasing) integer lists, merge them into one sorted list
  containing exactly the elements of both, WITH MULTIPLICITY.

  Unlike every prior `List`-fold solve (`L206`, `L213`, `L1143`), merge genuinely recurses on
  BOTH inputs at once — each step peels the smaller head off ONE of the two lists, leaving the
  other untouched.  A naive two-argument pattern match compiles to WELL-FOUNDED recursion (like
  `L62`'s `paths`/`L1143`'s naive `lcs`), so — following the `L322`/`L1143` fuel trick (Skill
  S13) — the program is a thin wrapper `mergeFn xs ys := mergeFuel (xs.length + ys.length) xs ys`
  over a FUEL-indexed helper `mergeFuel`, structural on the fuel and hence kernel-reducible
  (`decide` works directly).

  A pleasant simplification over `L1143`'s LCS: merge's fuel decrements are EXACT, not merely
  sufficient.  Once one list runs out, the answer is the other list VERBATIM — no further
  recursion, so the base cases cost no fuel at all.  And at the cons/cons step, the fuel handed
  to each recursive call is *exactly* that branch's own minimal requirement (never slack), so
  `mergeFn`'s defining recurrence (`mergeFn_cons_eq`) is recovered by ONE arithmetic rewrite
  (`List.length_cons` + `congrArg`), with no general "any sufficient fuel agrees" induction
  needed (contrast `L1143`'s `lcsFuel_stable`).

  1. **Program** — `mergeFn`, the textbook merge: compare the two heads, take the smaller,
     recurse on the rest.
  2. **Specification** — the honest LeetCode spec, phrased with NO order assumed on the recursion
     shape: **sortedness** (`Sorted`, the standard adjacent-pairs chain) and **exact multiset
     preservation** (`count v out = count v xs + count v ys` for every value `v`, `count` a plain
     fold).  Both hypotheses (`Sorted xs`, `Sorted ys`) are required — merge is not correct on
     unsorted inputs, matching the problem statement.
  3. **Correctness = `merge_correct`** — `Sorted xs → Sorted ys → Sorted (mergeFn xs ys) ∧ ∀ v,
     count v (mergeFn xs ys) = count v xs + count v ys`.  Sortedness of the output goes through a
     `LeHead` helper (`LeHead b l` = "`b` is `≤` l's head, or `l` is empty"): `Sorted (b :: l) ↔
     LeHead b l ∧ Sorted l` holds BY DEFINITION (`sorted_cons`), and `LeHead` is preserved by
     `mergeFn` in ONE line per branch (`leHead_merge`) since `LeHead` only ever inspects the very
     first element of the result, which `mergeFn_cons_eq` pins down exactly. The double induction
     (outer on `xs`, inner on `ys`, exactly `L1143`'s shape) then closes both halves together.

  Mathlib-free; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} (in fact the core `merge_correct` theorem, being
  pure `List Int`/`Nat`/`Int` reasoning with no `Rel(Set)` machinery, needs neither — only the
  `Rel(Set)` packaging below pulls those in).

/-! ## Program: the merge recurrence, via a fuel-indexed helper (Skill S13) -/

/-- `mergeFuel fuel xs ys` — the textbook merge, with an explicit FUEL bound so the recursion is
    ordinary structural recursion on `fuel` (not well-founded recursion on the shrinking pair of
    lists), keeping it kernel-reducible for `decide`.  Once either list is exhausted the answer is
    the other list VERBATIM, at NO fuel cost — only the cons/cons step spends one unit of fuel. -/

      if x ≤ y then x :: mergeFuel fuel xs (y :: ys) else y :: mergeFuel fuel (x :: xs) ys

/-- **The program**: merge two sorted lists, run with exactly enough fuel (`fuel := xs.length +
    ys.length`, an upper bound — the cons/cons step never actually needs more than
    `min (xs.length) (ys.length)`, but the safe sum bound keeps the arithmetic uniform). -/
