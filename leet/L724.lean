  LeetCode 724 — Find Pivot Index — as an ALLEGORY PROGRAM.

  Problem: given `nums : List Int`, find the LEFTMOST index `i` where the sum of the elements
  strictly to the left of `i` equals the sum of the elements strictly to the right of `i`; return
  `-1` (here: `none`) if no such index exists.

  1. **Data** — a plain `List Int` (no `SnocList` machinery needed, as in `L303`/`L238`); the answer
     object is `Option Nat` (`none` = no pivot).

  2. **Program** — `pivotFn nums := pivotScan nums.sum 0 0 nums`: a single left-to-right structural
     scan carrying `(i, leftSum)` against the precomputed `total := nums.sum`.  At index `i` holding
     element `x`, `x` is a pivot iff `leftSum = total - leftSum - x` (the running left sum equals the
     remaining right sum); the scan returns the FIRST such `i`, else `none`.  Plain single-argument
     structural recursion on the list (no fuel — the accumulator changes but the recursion target,
     the list, always shrinks, exactly `L303`'s `scanlAdd` shape).

  3. **Specification** — the HONEST per-index slice sums, no reference to the program's own running
     total: `leftSumAt nums i := (nums.take i).sum`, `rightSumAt nums i := (nums.drop (i+1)).sum`,
     `IsPivot nums i := i < nums.length ∧ leftSumAt nums i = rightSumAt nums i`.

  4. **Correctness** — the crux is ONE scan-invariant induction (`pivotScan_correct`), generalizing
     over the ALREADY-SCANNED prefix `pre` (so `xs = ` the unscanned suffix, `leftSum = pre.sum`,
     `total = pre.sum + xs.sum`) and proving, for the sub-scan `pivotScan total pre.length leftSum
     xs`: a `some k` return is a genuine pivot of `pre ++ xs` that is the LEFTMOST among indices
     `≥ pre.length`, and a `none` return means no index `≥ pre.length` is a pivot.  At `pre = []`
     this specializes to `pivotFn`'s full soundness + leftmost + none-completeness.  The pivot-index
     characterization at each step is the single iff `hiff : IsPivot (pre ++ (x::xs')) pre.length ↔
     leftSum = total - leftSum - x` — proved ONCE via the algebraic identity `total - leftSum - x =
     xs'.sum` (from `total = pre.sum + x + xs'.sum`, `List.sum_cons`) together with the CORE list
     lemmas `List.take_left`/`List.drop_left'` (`leftSumAt (pre++(x::xs')) pre.length = pre.sum`,
     `rightSumAt (pre++(x::xs')) pre.length = xs'.sum`) — this sidesteps re-deriving `L303`'s general
     `sum_append_int`/telescoping split for the per-index characterization; `sum_append_int` (imported
     from `L303`) is used only once, to maintain `leftSum + x = (pre ++ [x]).sum` across the recursive
     step (growing the prefix by one element).

  Mathlib-free; reuses `L303.sum_append_int` (core only proves `sum_append` for `List Nat`).  Axioms
  `⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}` — a straight `graph`/`Map` packaging, fully constructive.

/-- `pivotScan total i leftSum xs`: scan the (unscanned) suffix `xs`, whose first element sits at

    `leftSum = total - leftSum - x` (running left sum = remaining right sum).  Returns the first
    such index, else `none`.  Structural recursion on `xs` (the only argument that shrinks). -/

/-- **The scan invariant**: processing the unscanned suffix `xs` of `pre ++ xs` (with `leftSum =
    pre.sum` already accumulated and `total` fixed as the sum of the whole list) finds exactly the
    LEFTMOST pivot at or after index `pre.length`, or confirms none exists there. -/
