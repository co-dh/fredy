# TODO — remaining Chapter-2 items (Freyd, *Categories, Allegories*)

Status as of 2026-06-30. Everything below is **not yet formalized**; the rest of Chapter 2 is done
(see `COVERAGE.md`). Grouped by how reachable each is.

## ★ THE BOX-MATCHED THICKNESS — FAITHFUL to §2.431 (resolved 2026-06-30 from the original scan)

`PowerAllegory.eps_thick` is box-guarded (`codBox R = codBox ∋`). VERDICT after reading Freyd §2.431 (scan p.240):
this is **the book's definition**, not a deviation — §2.431 literally says "T is thick iff for all R such that
`R□ = T□` there exists R̂ ...". Freyd's thickness is box-matched, and §2.432/2.433/2.434 each construct a single
box-matched straight-thick `∋` per object — exactly this class. So **do NOT "fix" the class**: dropping the guard
(or adding an unguarded/box-family `∋`) would BREAK the faithful §2.432 `effective_pre_power_is_power` (and the
§2.433/§2.537 that build on it), which correctly produce only box-matched `∋`. (My earlier "deviation" framing
was wrong — extrapolated from §2.41's `∋_R = ∋_{R□}` notation without reading §2.431.)

So the four items below are NOT blocked by a class defect. They genuinely need MORE than a bare power allegory —
an UNGUARDED `∋` (classify every R, incl. naming `∅`). FOUNDATION DONE (commit 2f20f36): `UnguardedPowerAllegory`
(extends `PowerAllegory` with `eps_thick_all : ∀ R, ∃ map f, f∋=R`, Freyd §2.412/2.413) + `A_is_map'`/`A_eps_eq'`
(A(R) a map / A(R)∋=R for EVERY R) in `S2_4`; `relUnguardedPowerAllegory` (Rel(C) of a topos IS unguarded) in
`S2_41` = the non-vacuity witness. Bucket-1 items close OVER this refinement, no base-class change.
PROGRESS: §2.414-converse universal-property half DONE over it (`mapTranspose_existsUnique_all`, commit cccd487,
merged class `TabularUnitaryUnguardedPowerAllegory`): Map(A) has FULL power objects, ∅-naming included.

## Box-gated — partial committed, full close blocked by the wall above

- ~~**§2.441 (3)⟹(1)**~~ — **DONE** (`straightJoin_to_prePositive`, `S2_441`, commit 44fc9c8): over
  `UnguardedPowerAllegory`, ℓ=A(1)≫A(1), ϰ=A(1/∋) into [[[γ]]], disjointness via `A_zero_inter_A_one`.
  `prePositive_wellJoined_straightJoin_tfae'` closes the TFAE. Axioms [propext].
- **§2.433 full instance** — FOUNDATION DONE (`S2_433_SplEqInstance2`, commit f09be78): `SplEqObj` subtype +
  Cat/Allegory/Distributive/Division (mirrors `SplCorObj`), sorry-free. Per-object thickness `splEqTarget_thick`
  done; effective-split part DOABLE (`spl_equivalence_splits_map` + split object reflexive since Φ⊒E.idem⊒id).
  REAL BLOCKER (found 2026-06-30): the repo's `EffectiveAllegory` bundles `TabularAllegory` with eq-splitting,
  but `Spl(Eq)` is effective only in FREYD's weaker §2.169 sense (eq-relations split) and is NOT tabular — its
  §2.166 tabulation apex `1∩f≫Ψ≫g°` is COREFLEXIVE (lives in `Spl(Cor)`, not `Spl(Eq)`). So
  `effective_pre_power_is_power` (needs tabular-bundled Effective) doesn't apply. TWO paths to close: (a) restate
  §2.432 over Freyd's non-tabular "effective" (eq-split only) — needs checking `straight_factorization`/
  `exists_straight_thick_target` don't use tabular; or (b) §2.434 systemic completion (split coreflexives too)
  to recover tabularity. Architectural decision, not boilerplate.
- ~~**§2.537**~~ — **DONE** (`quot_effective_power_is_power_unguarded`, commit 28fe050): unconditional over the
  unguarded base (`EffectiveUnguardedPowerAllegory`); the §2.41 box-naming hbox is automatic when ∋ is unguarded.
- ~~**§2.414 converse**~~ — **DONE** (`mapTopos : Topos (Map A)`, `S2_41b`, commit af6d347): finite limits
  + full power objects + subobject classifier + `has_pow` all assembled over `TabularUnitaryUnguardedPower-
  Allegory`. Bridge `relOf(relPullback f U)=f≫relOf U` (from §2.147 cross-term) reduces `IsUniversalRel` to
  `mapTranspose_existsUnique_all`. §2.414 COMPLETE both directions. Axioms [propext, Classical.choice].
- ~~**§2.416 `hCotuple`**~~ — **DONE** (`hCotuple_of_coproduct` / `progenitor_straight_thick_of_coproduct`,
  S2_44, commit 308a811): discharged from binary coproducts + effectiveness via the coproduct mediator +
  §2.354 straightening. No box-gating.

## Real but large bridges/constructions (formalizable, multi-file)

- ~~**§2.414 forward**~~ — **DONE** (`relPowerAllegory`, S2_41, commit 5ce5b60): topos `C` ⟹ `Rel(C)` is a
  power allegory, via the topos membership `∋` (straight from classify-uniqueness, thick from the §2.413
  transpose). REMAINING for §2.414: the **converse** (a unitary tabular power allegory `A` ⟹ `Map(A)` is a
  topos) — needs the topos structure rebuilt on `Map(A)`. **§2.424** connected-power-topos corollary follows
  from the forward direction + §2.219.
- **§2.155–§2.158**, **§2.168** (⟨I,∃⟩ locale-valued), **§2.417** (generator counterexample) — specific
  model/example constructions.

## Universe wall (needs a class redesign, not a leaf file)

- **§2.224 `GloballyCompleteAllegory.disjointUnion`** instance — a `u`-indexed family's concatenated
  index escapes to `u+1`; global completion is complete only at the next universe level. Cascades to:
  - **§2.226 remainder** — "splitting maintains global completeness" / unit-iff-set-of-iso-types.
  - **§2.551 remainder** — the locale/Z-valued-sets equivalence of categories (`(-)⁺` representation).

## Genuine foundation walls (whole-subproject formalizations)

- **§2.227 / §2.33 / §2.331(iv)** — geometric/Stone representation, Moerdijk's theorem, `O(X)`-valued
  sets on metrizable spaces (locale/sheaf foundations + δ-dense defs).
- **§2.437 / §2.438** — r.e. relations / Gödel (recursion theory).
- **§2.418** — realizability topos (construction).
- **§2.451–§2.455 / §2.444–§2.446 / §2.56** — boolean/CH/well-pointed/cocartesian and metonymy-
  independence and independence-of-AC (set-theoretic model constructions).
- **§2.542** — topos ⟹ boolean topos + bicartesian rep (twin of §1.979).
- **§2.561 / §2.562 / §2.564–§2.56(12)** — need presheaf infrastructure.
- **§2.21(10)** — equational theory of representable distributive allegories (meta-theory of
  representability: union-free normal form + counterexample product).
